# Governance

The Servo project is governed by the **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)**, who are responsible for technical oversight of the project as laid out in the [**charter**](https://github.com/servo/project/blob/master/governance/CHARTER.md). The project follows a [Consensus Seeking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model.

Current members of the TSC can be found in the [servo/project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/servo/project/blob/master/governance/tsc/README.md). The TSC meets in public, and meetings are announced with an issue on the repository. All meeting minutes are published there.

The TSC can form subcommittees for detailed discussion of issues. Currently there are no active subcommittees.

Servo is a [Linux Foundation Europe Project](https://linuxfoundation.eu/en/projects).
