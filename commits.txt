    ;servoshell; --help etc now works on windows, as long as you run servoshell from a console
    # When servo is started from the command line, we still want output to be printed. On windows, due to us using the
    # `windows` subsystem (as opposed to the default `console` subsystem), this doesn't work out-of-the-box, and we need
    # to manually attempt to attach to the console of the parent process. If servo was not started from the command line,
    # then the call will fail, which we can ignore.
    # Since we can now have the best of both worlds (i.e  no popping up console window, and preserve stdout / stderr
    # when started from a console), we can now unconditionally use the `windows` subsystem. (On non-windows platforms,
    # `windows-subsystem` does nothing)
    # Testing: Manually tested. The original issue does not reproduce when redirecting stdout / stderr, so I don't see
    # a way to write an automated test.
    # Fixes: #40211

    editing
    # This fixes a bug where  would render with many carets. Reports vary, but in my case it would would be at the start
    # and end of every "word", as long as those cursors came before the actual cursor.
    # The actual cursor would render normally, except that it does not render immediately after a line break. This
    # appears to be a separate issue.
    # The issue occurs because `push_glyph_store_to_unbreakable_segment`
    # gets passed too long of a range. This bypasses the check here:

    # L1440
    # Testing: Tested with `./mach test-unit`. No new tests were added. Perhaps someone has an idea of how one could
    # test this. Also tested manually in multiple scenarios, including with a text input. I was not able to get Servo
    # to soft wrap in a textbox, maybe Servo does not support that currently. Ultimately I am not super confident about

    # Queuing a media element task given the media element to fire an event named `resize` at the media element shoud
    # be done:
    # - upon the initial `metadata` event from the media engine
    # https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#loading-the-media-resource:event-media-resize
    # - whenever the video dimensions are changed (readyState is not `HAVE_NOTHING`)
    # https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-video-element:event-media-resize
    # See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#event-media-resize

    # This is the minimal possible changes after I've tried several approaches. The original problem is tricky after
    # multi-window support, as we want to shutdown normally while not panic after no window is open to support Servodriver.
    # Testing:
    # 1. We no longer panic on

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40975	(@jdm, #40975)	script: Reverse retargeting algorithm for ShadowRoot.element[s]FromPoint. (#40975)
    # This implementation is not actually specified (see #40973 and https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/556),
    # but the implementation that we have is backwards. Other retargeting uses that describe "retarget _something_
    # against _another thing_" map to `something.retarget(another_thing)`, but what the current code was doing for
    # element[s]FromPoint was the equivalent of "retarget _this_ against each element", which is obviously wrong.
    # Testing: Newly-passing tests.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40981	(@tharkum, #40981)	html: Track the script/UA initiated media `seek` request (#40981)
    # The low-level media `seek` request could be initiated by script (DOM method call or setting of an IDL attribute),
    # by the user agent (seeking data) or by the media engine itself (e.g. gst_play_set_rate()).
    # And to distinguish between them we will use the latest seek position (in seconds) to be able abort processing the
    # `seek` algorithm steps (13-17) for a `seek` request initiated by the media engine.
    # See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-media-seek
    # If the `seeking` is in progress, any callback which affects the current playback position (`position changed`,
    # `end of the playback`) shouldn't be processed (event marshalling over IPC router is non-state conditional).
    # Testing: Regression in the following test causes by gstreamer issue when the `gst_play_set_rate()` overrides the
    # latest seek requested position unconditionally and the user agent receives the `seek completion` event with the

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40902	(@Loirooriol, @mrobinson, #40902)	script: Don't dirty with ContentOrHeritage damage when changing state (#40902)
    # When for example changing the hover state of an element, we were dirtying it with ContentOrHeritage damage, which
    # forced it to be laid out again.
    # This was added in #39102 in order to fix #38989, but for the most part it's no longer needed.
    # However, we will now dirty when a `` or `` which can be selected gets or loses focus. This is to ensure that the
    # caret or selections get correctly updated.
    # Testing: Manually tested that #38989 is not regressing

    ;api; new SimpleDialog / AlertDialog / ConfirmDialog / PromptDialog interface, harder to misuse and reduces boilerplate for embedders that want to ignore dialogs
    # Finish exposing the `SimpleDialog` API in libservo, abstracting away the
    # response senders into structures with methods. In addition, add a
    # default behavior so that embedders do not have to explicitly send a
    # reponse when dialogs are ignored. This makes the API much harder to
    # misuse.
    # Finally, the WebDriver API for setting the prompt dialog entry
    # field is corrected to actually set that value rather than the message.
    # This makes sense as part of this change as the type safety of the
    # structures makes setting the message (the old, wrong behavior) harder
    #  to implement.
    # Testing: This causes a WebDriver conformance test to start passing.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40997	(@dyegoaurelio, #40997)	Block and report CSP violations for javascript: URLs in window.open (#40997)
    # Previously, when window.open() was called with a javascript: URL, the script would execute unconditionally without
    # any CSP enforcement. The CSP list was not propagated from the opener to the newly opened document.
    # This commit fixes two issues:
    # 1. Propagate CSP from opener to new document The CSP list from the existing (opener) document is now copied to
    # the target document before navigation, ensuring CSP policies are enforced.
    # 2. Report CSP violations to the correct window Per the CSP spec, violations should be reported to the navigation
    # request's client (the opener window), not the target window. To achieve this, we check CSP early in window.open() while
    # both windows are accessible, before entering the normal navigation flow where only the target window is available.
    # Testing: new wpt successes:
    # - `content-security-policy/script-src/javascript-window-open-blocked.html`
    # - `content-security-policy/unsafe-hashes/javascript_src_denied_missing_unsafe_hashes-window_open.html`

    ;api; see SERVO_DIAGNOSTICS patch
    # With this change can now configure diagnostic logging via the `SERVO_DIAGNOSTICS` environment variable in addition
    # to the existing -Z command-line flag.
    # The environment variable accepts the same comma-separated options as -Z (e.g.,
    # `SERVO_DIAGNOSTICS=style-tree,display-list`). The help option works from both sources and will display all available
    # diagnostic flags.
    # Environment variable parsing is disabled in production builds
    # Testing: Tested locally for release, debug and production build to make sure it is disabled for production
    # Fixes: Part of https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/40863
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41027	(@tharkum, #41027)	html: Change the `play` state of the media player if the old is opposite (#41027)
    # It's important to check the media player's `paused` state to avoid unnecessary changes to its internal state (via
    # `play`, `pause`), including configuration the `playback rate` and `volume` properties.
    # Depends on https://github.com/servo/media/pull/467
    # Testing: The expected test results are unchanged because it is the implicit performance improvements of the media
    # stack, with the exception of the following test, which is affected by the `playback rate` state caching mechanism
    # (the `seek` position is not overridden for default playback rate (1.0)).

    # Moving IndexedDB to use the generic channel methods.
    # Of note is the change in 'IDBRequest::execute_async'. This method previously added a channel that was constructed
    # from the callsite in put into the AsyncOperation. Now we do not take a function but take a 'FnOnce(GenericCallback>)
    # -> AsyncOperation'. With this the callsite can construct the AsyncOperation to give in the 'IndexedDBThreadMsg::Async'.
    # The rest are mostly just type changes.
    # Signed-off-by: Narfinger
    # Testing: WPT tests on the IndexedDB subset still pass.

    # Some mobile websites only have touch event listeners, but not any for mouse events. We add native touch
    # support for "element click", for Android/OHOS. We are finally utilizing `subtype` and can remove the
    # `dead_code` macro for it: we dispatch action based on the subtype given, which has impact for [Perform
    # Actions](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-actions) **on all platforms**.
    # Testing:
    # 1. Tested on OHOS for a normal webpage, plus a special webpage that only has touch event listener.
    # 2. Desktop: Previously, we always ignore the requested of pointer subtype and dispatch the mouse. All 138 stable
    # unexpected test actually never worked, and now crash due to "Got a touchmove event for a non-active touch point"
    # since we can dispatch touch now. I plan to improve this and make it work soon!

    # TODO later: When we have touch simulation for Desktop, "Element click" should also dispatch pointer touch.

    # Fix IIRFilter crash on silent blocks and add crash test.
    # Before fix: `let blocks: SmallVec = SmallVec::new();` followed by `blocks.as_slice().iter().map(.)`, Because blocks
    # was empty, the iterator never produced anything, so the resulting Chunk had zero blocks and caused:
    # ```
    # panic: index out of bounds: the len is 0 but the index is 0 (thread AudioRenderThread, at
    # /home/runner/.cargo/git/checkouts/media-9074def3f0bdf023/b0d3b74/audio/iir_filter_node.rs:173)
    # ```
    # Now: we still use SmallVec, but we actually push a block into it before returning: create Block::default(), call
    # explicit_silence() on it, blocks.push(block), then Chunk { blocks }. This ensures the chunk contains one explicit
    # silent block, which is what downstream code expects.
    # Actual fix is in:

    # surface. This happens if the context was created but never used for rendering, as seen in the linked issue. Since

    # Bumps [slotmap](https://github.com/orlp/slotmap) from 1.0.7 to 1.1.1.
    # Changelog
    # Sourced from slotmap's changelog.
    # Version 1.1.1
    # Added as_slices and as_mut_slices to DenseSlotMap. The other methods
    # added in 1.1.0 (keys_as_slice, values_as_slice and
    # values_as_mut_slice) will likely be removed in 2.0.
    # Version 1.1.0
    # Bumped MSRV to 1.58.
    # Fixed memory leak in clone_from.
    # Added keys_as_slice, values_as_slice, and values_as_mut_slice to
    # DenseSlotMap.
    # Ensured that is_null() keys print as null in their Debug representation.
    # Made KeyData::new and KeyData::from_ffi const.
    # Resolved a Miri error in get_disjoint_mut under the Stacked Borrows model.
    # Added detach and reattach methods to SlotMap and DenseSlotMap which
    # let you temporarily remove key/value pairs from the slot map before
    # adding them back.
    # Deprecated HopSlotMap, preparing for removal in 2.0.

    # Part of this also involves removing the redundant `RemoveWebView`
    # message to the `Compositor`. This is handled now in the `WebView` `Drop`

    # didn't consider touch/pen support well enough: #41042.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41087	(@eerii, #41087)	devtools: Update to Firefox 145 (#41087)
    ;devtools
    # Update the target spec version from 133 to 145. Solves a few issues with incorrect or outdated messages, such as
    # an error with `reflow`.
    # The only meaningful change I could find is that the performance actor is now called "perf" instead of "performance". It
    # is part of a set of global actors that the root handles. I made it more explicit and moved the global actor
    # registration inside of the root actor, it makes more sense to have it there.
    # Finally, I ordered the message handling alphabetically. The only changed entry is `getRoot` because of the global
    # actors.
    # Testing: I manually tested the functionalities and checked the logs.

    ;api; see other root certs change
    # This change fixes a variety of build warnings on Android. In a related
    # change, the CA verifier preference allows using a list of certificate
    # overrides and the `rust-webpki` verifier regardless of platform. Whether
    # to use a list of certificate overrides and whether to use the platform
    # verifier are orthagonal, so this change unlinks those two and in the process
    # fixes a build warning on Android.
    # Testing: This preference is untested (and quite hard to test honestly), so this change
    # does not have tests. There should be no behavior change unless using a combination
    # of forcing the webpki verifier and providing a list of CA overrides.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40939	(@gterzian, @Taym95, #40939)	indexeddb: move database open and upgrade transaction to in parallel. (#40939)
    # The spec concept of [opening a database](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB-2/#open-a-database), and the conditional
    # [upgrade of a database](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#upgrade-a-database), should be run in-parallel, meaning
    # on the backend indexeddb thread, and not on the script-thread.
    # This implements the move, but retains a blocking wait on the upgrade transaction finish. It is the first step towards a
    # larger refactoring(see https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/40983), which will see concepts like transaction lifecyle
    # and connection queues be implemented on the indexeddb thread, and which will make any waiting non-blocking as well.
    # Other smaller changes to support the above are:
    # - returning whether a physical db was created when instantiating the db engine.
    # - using a global counter to produce transaction ids.
    # Testing: New failures on WPT tests: to be fixed as part of several follow-ups.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41233	(@mrobinson, #41233)	fonts: Calculate font keys count via number of font keys and not number of `Painter`s (#41233)
    # The changes in #39140 introduced a pretty subtle bug in the way that the
    # number of font keys to generate are calculated. The code was previously
    # trying to handle the case where only a single kind of font key needed to
    # be generated. In that case, one of the stores might not be empty and it
    # would just generate the difference between the remaining keys and the
    # max.
    # In #39140, the data structures were changed to hold a map of `Painter`s
    # to key stores, yet the calculation lines remained the same. This means
    # that the number of `Painter`s was subtracted from the maximum number of
    # keys. This could lead to situations where the number of keys requested
    # was always 0.
    # This change fixes that.
    # Testing: This turned up in testing when converting the WebDriver to use
    # multiple windows. This change allows that to work properly, so the test is
    # effectively that change.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41228	(@jdm, #41228)	script: Use rooted typed arrays in generated code and buffer source APIs (#41228)
    # There are two flavours of the mozjs `TypedArray` wrapper for typed array objects: one stores a `Box>`, while the
    # other just has a bare `*mut JSObject`. The second one must only be stored inside the `CustomAutoRoot` rooting values,
    # but we were using it in many other places like WebIDL dictionaries without rooting it safely. These changes make
    # our typed array APIs always use `RootedTraceableBox>` with the `Box>` flavour, which ensures that the JS object
    # stored inside the typed array wrapper is always visible to the SpiderMonkey GC.
    # Testing: Adds a new test that crashes without these changes.

    ;dom; crypto.subtle.exportKey() for `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5`, `RSA-PSS`, `RSA-OAEP`
    # This patch implements export key operations of three RSA algorithms (RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, RSA-OAEP, RSA-OAEP), with
    # `rsa` crate.
    # The three operations are very similar to each other, so we can implement them as a single function, located at a

    # sub-module `rsa_common`, in order to slightly differentiate the behavior of the step (Step 3.4 of "jwk" format)
    # that are different among the three RSA algorithms.
    # Testing:

    # - Some new FAIL expectations are added. They were skipped by WPT when the export key operations of RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5,

    # As previously described in #41150 , `InlineFormattingContext::font_metrics` contains info that are easily accessible

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41262	(@Loirooriol, #41262)	layout: Treat `<audio>` as replaced and do not display when there is no `controls` attribute (#41262)
    # Add an important UA style to ensure that `` isn't displayed at all when it doesn't have the `controls` attribute. This
    # matches Gecko, Blink and WebKit.
    # When it does have the attribute, then treat it as replaced. For example, this means that it won't stretch by default
    # if it's block-level, that it will be atomic if inline-level, and that it won't generate boxes for its children
    # (including `::before` and `::after`).
    # Previously we were generating `::before` and `::after`, but there was a bug: if they had some replaced content,
    # the controls of the `` would be duplicated, and also appear on the pseudo-element. Then, since the various boxes for
    # the controls would be backed by the same elements, Servo could panic because of a double borrow. This is now avoided.
    # Testing: Some WPT are now passing, also adding a new crashtest. There is one failure about `innerText`, but the
    # test is probably wrong, now we match other browsers.

    # lot of RefCell already borrowed crashes are because of code like this:

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41232	(@TimvdLippe, #41232)	script: Implement storing deferred fetches (#41232)
    # This is the first part of preparation for implementing the keepalive flag for requests. It requires implementation of
    # the concept of a task group, which we already sort of have with `DocumentLoader`. Therefore, we currently already
    # cancel any loads, which should be updated to ignored kept-alive requests.
    # However, termination also requires storing of deferred fetches, which are also kept-alive. Therefore, to distinguish
    # the two, we need to store them separately as stated with the TODO.
    # In a follow-up, we can then skip canceling keep-alive requests for both `navigator.sendBeacon` (which aren't
    # deferred) and `fetchLater` (which are deferred).

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41293	(@janvarga, #41293)	storage: Add support for listing WebStorage origins (#41293)
    # This PR adds support for listing origins that have associated WebStorage
    # data.
    # Both localStorage and sessionStorage are supported. For sessionStorage,
    # origins are reported if data exists in any browsing context, while only
    # localStorage origins persist across restarts.
    # The implementation introduces an internal origin descriptor abstraction
    # to support future extensions, such as reporting perorigin usage.
    # This functionality is primarily intended to be used by `SiteDataManager`.
    # Testing: Added a unit test covering origin listing before and after restart.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41314	(@mrobinson, #41314)	servoshell: Do not forward key events to egui when no widget is focused (#41314)
    # When no egui widget is focused, the `WebView` itself is effectively
    # focused, so we should not forward keyboard events to egui. This change
    # does that as well as switch the key processing function in `Gui` to use
    # an early return approach for all events that should go immediately to
    # the `WebView` or are otherwise consumed.
    # Eventually, key events that are not consumed by the `WebView` should be
    # forwarded back to `egui`, so that the user can, for instance, tab out of
    # the `WebView`, but this requires having a version of winit with:
    # rust-windowing/winit#4026

    # This PR introduces an initial `SiteDataManager` abstraction intended

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41235	(@mrobinson, #41235)	servoshell: Create new WebDriver `WebView`s in new toplevel windows (#41235)
    ;servoshell; webdriver now uses multiple windows when creating new webviews
    # This change makes it is that WebDriver can create whole new windows for
    # each new `WebView` in servoshell. The motivation for this is:
    # 1. This is how the WebDriver specification is written. The command that
    #    create a new WebView is actually called "New Window" [^1], so this
    #    increases compliance with the specification and now we obey the
    #    type hint sent with that command.
    # 2. This change allows testing multi-window support via the WPT.
    # 3. This will allow adding optimizations (#39923) that are otherwise
    #    impossible because the WPT expects all open `WebView` to be live and
    #    visible.
    # This does not make the change yet for windows opened via `window.open()`
    # (popups), as that requires #41220 to fix. In order to make this possible
    # a few changes to the code had to take place:
    # 1. The new `PlatformWindow` creation function has to be passed down to
    #    the WebDriver handler, which normally doesn't know how to make
    #    `PlatformWindow`s.
    # 2. This allows moving the UI command code back to the shared part of
    #    servoshell, meaning that the embedded ports can use it as well
    #    eventually.
    # 3. Headless windows need a real id to differeniate them now intead of
    #    just 0.
    # 4. When dropping the headless `PlatformWindow` we need to make it
    #    current. I'm not sure why surfman doesn't do this, but this is now
    #    necessary as there are multiple contexts. This is also true when
    #    resizing the `RenderingContext`.
    # Finally, errors when making the context current are upgraded to
    # `error!`s as they typically break the entire execution of the program.
    # [^1]: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#new-window
    # Testing: This is tested by the entire WPT suite.

    # Speedometer is failing on main after recent changes. The symptom is that when creating the webdriver (in python
    # on the host) servo switches to `about:blank`. This is not expected by the script and hence we fail to find the
    # start button, since the expected page is the speedometer page.
    # The quick fix is just navigating to the page after creating the driver, but we also take this opportunity to
    # slightly refactor this script and use the common method for running tests, which allows removing some code.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41318	(@mrobinson, #41318)	libservo: Allow responding to auxiliary `WebView` open requests asynchronously (#41318)
    # This change renames the `WebView::request_open_auxiliary_webview` to
    # `WebView::request_create_new` and allows responding to it
    # asynchronously. A new `CreateNewWebViewRequest` is exposed that keeps
    # the response sender alive as long as it is not dropped. If dropped
    # without a response, the original request is denied with `None`.
    # This also makes the API a bit harder to misuse, because the public
    # `WebViewBuilder::new_auxiliary` factory is no longer exposed, in favor
    # of `CreateNewWebViewRequest::builder`. This makes it impossible to
    # create an auxiliary `WebView` without a corresponding request. This
    # still isn't the idea API, which would be to make creating an auxiliary
    # `WebView` and normal `WebView` exactly the same, but it's an
    # improvement.
    # This will allow opening auxiliary `WebView`s in new toplevel platform
    # windows in servoshell. That will be handled in a followup. In addition,
    # the `CreateNewWebViewRequest` can eventually hold the arguments passed
    # to `window.open`.
    # Testing: Corresponding changes are made in servoshell, which means that
    # this is tested by the WPT calling `window.open`.
    # Fixes: #41220.

    ;dom; partial support for <meta charset>
    # Servo currently completely ignores `` tags. When we find one with an encoding that is incompatible to the current
    # one, then we should reload the page and start over with the new encoding. A common optimization that has even
    # made its way into the specification is to wait for a few bytes to arrive and inspect them for `meta` tags, so the
    # browser is able to use the correct encoding from the very beginng.
    # In practice, I've run into problems with our WPT harness when reloading the page after `meta` tags. Therefore, this
    # change implement the optimization first, so we never have to reload when running WPT. I've implemented prescanning
    # in a way where we wait for 1024 bytes to arrive or for one second to pass, whichever one happens first.

    # This method now allows you to pass in a custom registry. The registry isn't used yet for callers, since we don't
    # support scoped registries. However, as we now pass in the registry to `Node::clone`, we set the registry when
    # creating elements and cloning them.
    # As such, various tests start passing where we set the registry. Some tests started failing, but they rely on
    # scoped registries which we don't support yet. These tests thus flipped: those that were erroneously failing are
    # now passing and vice versa.

    # For some dictionaries in SubtleCrypto interface, we store the hash field of `HashAlgorithmIdentifier` type as a

    # The specification has a dedicated method for destroying

    # This change moves the `UserContentManager` abstraction from the `ServoBuilder` to `WebViewBuilder` so that embedders
    # can inject content for each `WebView` independently. It also adds basic support for runtime mutations to the
    # `UserContentManager` API. Only adding new scripts is currently supported, but future changes will add support for
    # both other mutations such as removal of scripts and addition & removal of stylesheets. Future changes could also
    # optimize the way mutations are propagated to `ScriptThread`s by sending just the "delta" rather than the whole
    # `UserContents` structure for each mutation.
    # The `UserContentManager` now becomes just a convenient handle for the embedders to invoke the mutation API while
    # the actual management of the manager's content is handled by the Constellation. The mutations are relayed to the
    # constellation via messages. The change also separates the serialized version containg the user contents into a new
    # `UserContent` structure so that the API cannot be misused.
    # Testing: New unit tests have been added for the different scenarios involving UserContentManager.

    dom; fix persistence of localStorage data
    # This PR fixes WebStorage SQLite writes by switching to `UPDATE` and `INSERT` as a
    # temporary fallback.
    # The previous `UPSERT` statement assumes a `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` constraint
    # on `key`, which is not yet guaranteed by the current schema and causes write
    # failures. Using `UPDATE` and `INSERT` avoids this issue until a proper schema
    # migration is implemented.
    # A TODO is left to switch back to `UPSERT` once the schema is updated.
    # Testing: Manual testing only. This issue primarily manifests when the
    # application does not shut down cleanly (which is common on Android). In that
    # case, `save()` is not invoked and persistence relies entirely on `set()`,
    # making this difficult to reliably cover with automated tests.

    # This change reworks the logic for finding font fallbacks to make it
    # simpler. I was involved with writing the code for `FontGroupFamily` and
    # `FontGroupFamilyMember` and I still struggle a bit with understanding
    # it, so I've chosen to do this. In addition, the change is in preparation

    # The main changes here are:
    #  1. Move the logic for creating a new descriptor with variations into
    #     the Font constructor.
    #  2. Add some more general methods to `FontGroupFamily` such as a
    #     template iterator.
    #  3. Use `OnceLock` to avoid a convoluted code structure because of
    #     mutability and also having boolean "loaded" members. This is what
    #     `OnceLock` and `OnceCell` are for!
    #  4. Rename `FontGroupFamilyMember` to `FontGroupFamilyTemplate` to
    #     stress that it is one template of a particular `FontGroupFamily`.

    # Bumps [jiff](https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff) from 0.2.16 to 0.2.17.

    # 0.2.17 (2025-12-24)
    # This release contains binary size improvements to Jiff, more succinct error
    # messages and some new minor APIs.
    # While Jiff 1.0 is overdue, I've been doing a lot of experimenting with
    # improving Jiff's binary size and compile times. In particular, I want to spend
    # time doing this before Jiff 1.0 so that we don't box ourselves into a corner.
    # (For example, some binary size improvements may require minor API breaking
    # changes.)
    # In this release, Jiff has switched to structured error handling internally
    # in an effort to provide error predicates and also hopefully improve binary
    # sizes and compile times. Overall this didn't have as big of an impact on
    # binary sizes or compile times as I was hoping. I did take this opportunity to
    # make Jiff's error messages a bit more succinct. In many cases, this involved
    # de-duplicating some aspects of error messages and omitting user provided input
    # in the messages. If you feel like there is a significant decrease in error
    # message quality that isn't easily amended by callers providing additional
    # context themselves, please open an issue.
    # This release also updates Jiff's bundled copy of the [IANA Time Zone Database]
    # to 2025c. See the 2025c release announcement for more details.

    ;layout; fix matching of certain selectors containing ‘:link’
    # In Servo, the `:link` and `:any-link` pseudo-classes correctly match link elements when they are part of a compound
    # selector whose last simple selector does not start with them (e.g. `a:link` or `:link b`), but they do not match
    # when the last simple selector starts with `:link`.
    # The reason for this seems to be that Stylo uses two methods to determine whether an element is an (unvisited)
    # link: to call the `is_link()` method on the `selectors::Element` trait, and to check if the element's state has
    # `ElementState::UNVISITED` set.
    # In a browser like Servo which does not support visited styles, these two checks should be equivalent. However,
    # they turn out not to be, because Servo never actually sets `ElementState::UNVISITED`.
    # Since per the HTML spec the `:link` selector applies to all `` and `` elements that have an `href` attribute,
    # this patch fixes this by setting `ElementState::UNVISITED` on such elements when the `href` attribute is set,
    # and by unsetting it when it is removed.
    # Testing: There are two invalidation-related WPT tests about the `:any-link` selector that now pass with this patch.

    ;layout; fix intrinsic sizes containing floats
    # The computation of the min-content and max-content sizes of an inline formatting context was ignoring floated contents.
    # Now we will take them into account.
    # Testing: One test is now passing. Note there isn't much test coverage because there is no spec, and browsers aren't
    # fully interoperable. More tests should be added as part of https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9120

    ;layout; fix anonymous blocks near floats
    # When computing the intrinsic sizes of a block container which doesn't establish an inline formatting context,
    # block-level children which don't establish an independent formatting context clear floats. That's because these
    # blocks overlap the floats instead of being placed next to them.
    # However, we shouldn't do that if the block-level child is an anonymous box that establishes an inline formatting
    # context. This matches what other browsers do.

    editing; part of fixing unicode offset bugs
    # This moves the Unicode offset types to the `base` crate and makes them
    # generally more usable throughout the Servo codebase. In addition, they
    # are renamed to use Rust naming and to be a bit more consistent:
    #  - `UTF8Bytes` -> `Utf8CodeUnitLength`
    #  - `UTF16CodeUnits` -> `Utf16CodeUnitLength`
    # There is also a bit more documentation explaining their use.
    # This is preparation for fixing issues with UTF-16 offsets in editable
    # text fields.
    # Testing: This does not change behavior so existing WPT tests should suffice.

    # This PR updates `SiteDataManager::site_data` to group entries by eTLD+1

    # Change quota accounting for `WebStorage` so that usage is tracked per storage
    # type instead of combining `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` into a single per

    # The previous implementation summed the sizes of both storage types and applied

    # to data stored in `localStorage` (and vice-versa), and also resulted in origin

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41550	(@jschwe, #41550)	ci: Skip tests if ohos build failed (#41550)
    # Since the build job has `continue-on-error: true` to avoid failing the workflow, we need to check the success
    # of the build step in the test jobs to skip the jobs, if the build fail. Currently those jobs run, but fail when
    # trying to download the build artifact.
    # Testing:
    # - [mach try ohos](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20556636022) (with the build succeeding)
    # - [mach try ohos](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20557565744/job/59043826203) with the build
    # force-failing, showing that the dependant jobs are properly skipped now
    # Notes:
    # - `if: github.repository == 'servo/servo' && needs.build-harmonyos-aarch64.result == 'success'` does not work, jobs are
    # still spawned, see [mach try ohos, with failing build step](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20556664058)

    # Cancellations are still present in a document loader

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41563	(@kkoyung, #41563)	script: Properly implement `supportedAlgorithms` of WebCrypto (#41563)
    ;dom; more crypto.subtle changes
    # WebCrypto API has an internal object `supportedAlgorithms`  that maps the all supported algorithms and operations
    # to their desired IDL dictionary types. It is mainly used by the "normalize an algorithm" algorithm . We currently
    # implement it as a large `match` block in the `normalize_algorithm` function.
    # This patch properly implements the internal object `supportedAlgorithms` as a new enum type `SupportedAlgorithm`.
    # By doing so, we can reduce a lot of string comparison to enum matching, which can be done faster. This patch
    # also separates the dictionary conversion away from the `match` block to make our code cleaner. Furthermore,
    # the `exportKey()` method can now utilize the new `SupportedAlgorithm` to properly check against the algorithm
    # registration, instead of hard-coding an list of unsupported algorithms by itself.
    # Testing: Refactoring. Existing tests suffice.
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41551	(@jschwe, #41551)	ohos CI: Improve visibility of failed steps (#41551)
    # Using `continue-on-error: true` for a specfic step in a job, has the
    # huge downside that the step is marked as green / sucess in the UI, which
    # can make it very confusing for people trying to figure out why / where
    # the job failed.
    # This PR avoids this by removing `continue-on-error` from steps in the
    # bench job. Instead, we move all setup code to a place before we run the
    # benchmarks and add appropriate `if` conditions to later jobs, so
    # that we can still run both benchmarks, even if the first one fails.
    # Testing:
    # - [mach try ohos](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20558990407), with passing tests
    # - [mach try ohos](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20559189961) with force-failed speedometer step

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41564	(@sagudev, #41564)	script: Obtain `&mut JSContext` at the start of the script and pass it down to msg handlers (#41564)
    # At the start of the script we create first (and only[^1]) safe `JSContext`, from where we should pass it down to
    # every code that needs the cx. This PR brings it all the way down to message handlers. There is clear separation
    # between functions that use new model `&mut JSContext` and the ones that use the old model (usually they take can_gc).
    # [^1]:  Another place of construction are SM hooks (that pass us down raw JSContext), but to reach that point we already
    # needed to call another function that takes `&mut JSContext`, so one can look at this case as reentering/reborrowing
    # (we derive new shorter `&mut JSContext` from the old one).
    # Testing: This is just refactor, but should covered by WPT tests.
