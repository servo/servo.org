    perf; faster animated GIF rendering
    # Canvas expects input data to be in RGBA premultiplied format and
    # WebRender already supports RGBA and BGRA data as long as they are
    # premultiplied. Pre-multiplying up front allows:
    # - Avoiding many conversions when painting images to canvas.
    # - Passing the `RasterImage` IpcSharedMemory of the image instead of creating
    #   a new one with the premultiplied data every time we upload to
    #   WebRender. This is a big deal for animated gifs, because before every
    #   frame was creating a new shared memory segment.
    # It seems that for rasterized SVGs were were already putting
    # premultplied data into the `RasterImage` so it's quite likely SVGs were
    # being composited incorrectly.
    # Testing: This causes 8 tests to start passing and 2 tests to fail in the WebGL conformance suite.
    # The failures are due to the fact that premultiplying alpha is lossy when alpha is 0. In that case,
    # the resulting color of a blend operation might be wrong. This is typically only a problem if you
    # use RGBA data as RGB data, which is pretty unusual. In the case that you are blending with
    # RGBA the final color values will be 0 or close to 0 anyway. Gecko solves this issue by having a
    # cacheable surface generation API that can fetch both premulitplied and unpremulitplied data
    # from things like image elements. We do not have that yet, but I argue that this change
    # is important anyway due to the amount that it reduces memory and file descriptor usage
    # as well as the cost of copying image data so much in memory.

    perf; LCP measurement
    # Steps for calculating LCP:
    # 1. When the pref for `largest_contentful_paint_enabled` is enabled, `LargestContentfulPaintCandidateCollector`
    # is created once per LayoutThread using `viewport_size`.
    # 2. While building the `display_list`, it send the pre-calculated `clip_rect` and  `bounds` to   `LCPCollector`
    # along with `transform` and `LCPCandidateType` for `visual_rect` calculation for `LCPCandidates`.
    # 3. After `visual_rect` calculation, update the `lcp_candidate` based on `area` of `visual_rect` and send it to
    # `compositor`.
    # 4. Then among `lcp_candidates`, we find out the `largest_contentful_paint` and send it to `paint_metric`
    # 5. In addition to above `LCP` also uses `PaintMetricState` to save console from spamming with duplicate entries.
    # This PR includes following commits better segregation of code
    # 1. Add `LargestContentfulPaintCandidate` struct
    # 2. Add `LargestContentfulPaintCandidateCollector`
    # 6. Collect the `LargestContentfulPaintCandidates`when feature is enabled.
    # 7. Send the `LargestContentfulPaintCandidates` to compositor
    # 8. Add `LargestContentfulPaintCalculator`
    # 9. Calculates the `LargestContentfulPaint`
    # 10. Send `LCP` to `PaintMetrics`
    # 11. Disable `LCP` feature on user interaction
    # Elements considered for LCP in this PR:
    # - Image element

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40128	(@aaron-wgd, #40128)	servoshell/desktop: Draw WebViews without using an egui::CentralPanel (#40128)
    # Showing a CentralPanel causes egui to claim touch events over the WebView, making workarounds like that in [commit
    # f182f74](https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/f182f748ab31e75e585c59681648739b3c77132a) necessary. Since we are
    # only using the panel to determine the size of the WebView, we can also use ctx.available_rect() instead.
    # The reason I looked into this is that I noticed servoshell very often (but not always) panicking when I end touch
    # events on my linux/wayland. It was pretty clear that this was triggered by touch start events not being forwarded
    # to compositing/touch.rs such that the end events acted on inconsistent state. This happened because egui claimed
    # to consume the start events, just like for pinch zoom in commit f182f74.
    # Extending the workaround to touch start events fixes my panics as well. But while I was at it, I looked
    # into egui's code, where the decision to count all space as used by egui after adding a central panel happens
    # [here](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/f6fa74c66578be17c1a2a80eb33b1704f17a3d5f/crates/egui/src/pass_state.rs#L360).
    # It looks intentional - by adding a central panel, we are expressing our intention to let egui handle events not
    # just in the side panels, but everywhere. I think this commit is therefore a cleaner way to handle this instead of
    # extending the workaround - but I'm not certain and curious what y'all think!
    # The fact that the commit title of f182f74 mentions macOS and that the panics on ending touch events were not noticed
    # when pinch gestures were added makes me worry that there is some platform dependency here that I do not understand,
    # so it would probably be best if someone on different platforms tested this as well.
    # Finally, we were actually adding two central panels [in the previous
    # code](https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/025abc855ef4f2225db4e2a28e5d29529dbf9894/ports/servoshell/desktop/minibrowser.
    # rs#L453).
    # I suspect that was unintentional, at least dialogs seem to work fine if I call `state.for_each_active_dialog(..)`
    # outside of a panel.
    # Testing: Tested manually on linux/wayland.
    # Fixes: Intermittent panics on touch end events, see above.

    # inheritance of `TestExecutor` base class.
    # Another issue is that new changes in the

    # with the assumptions in Servo's executor:
    #   - The `dpi` argument is used as an `int` although it is a string
    #   - The `viewport_size` argument is treated as a tuple of ints but it is
    #     in fact a string of the format `WxH`. It also treats the viewport
    #     dimensions as being specified in device pixel coordinates while
    #     Servo treats it as logical coordinates and will scale it by `dpi`.

    # When resize observations are skipped, they get delayed until the next turn of the event loop. In headless tests,
    # we're not guaranteed that this next turn occurs in time, unless some other event happens to run. This leads to
    # intermittent results unless we ensure that the event loop will run again.
    # Testing: Newly passing test.

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40461	(@mrobinson, #40461)	net: Simplify `FetchResponseListener` and move it to `script` (#40461)
    # `FetchReponseListener` has traditionally lived in `net` even though it
    # is only used in `script` currently. Because of the two way dependency,
    # it has also use a lot of templating to implement something pretty basic
    # (call methods on a trait object).
    # This change moves the trait to `script` and removes several levels of
    # templating, making the code quite a bit shorter and easier to
    # understand.

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40453	(@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40453)	net: Use callbacks instead of IPC channels in the `ImageCache` API (#40453)
    # Previously, the `ImageCache` would inform consumers of changes to image
    # availability by messaging an IPC channel. This isn't great, because it
    # requires serialization and deserialization. Nowadays, `ImageCache`s are
    # always owned by the same `Global` that uses them. This change replaces
    # the IPC channel with callback that implements `Send`.
    # For the case of normal HTML document images, the results are still sent
    # over the pre-existing Crossbeam channel that was connected via an IPC
    # route. A followup change might eliminate that channel entirely.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior so is covered by existing tests.

    # Right now when the Reload action is selected from a right-click context menu, Servo would
    # panic. Context menu's Reload action was calling `Location.Reload()`, which caused the panic. As per [HTML
    # spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-location-reload) it looks like, to perform a user-requested
    # reload we should be using `reload_without_origin_check()` instead.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40451	(@simonwuelker, #40451)	xpath: Enforce tree order in node sets during evaluation (#40451)
    # This change adds `NodeSet`, which is more or less a `Vec` that knows whether it is sorted, and can sort itself if
    # it isn't. This allows us to efficiently enforce tree order in intermediary node sets that occur during evaluation.
    # Notably, in many cases it is not necessary to sort at all, because all location step expressions yield node
    # sets that are either already sorted (`Axis::DescendantOrSelf` for example), or that are in inverse tree order
    # (`Axis::PrecedingSiblings` for example).
    # There's still optimization work left to be done. When merging two node sets that are already sorted then we could
    # use merge sort instead of appending one to the other and naively sorting. But I suspect that the sorting algorithm
    # used by the standard library is already well tuned to handle such cases...

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40429	(@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40429)	script: Handle broken image icon in `HTMLImageElement` (#40429)
    # Instead of having the `ImageCache` return the broken image icon for
    # failed loads, have `HTMLImageElement` explicitly request it. This means
    # that the image is loaded on demand (reducing the usage of resources) and
    # also simplifying the interface of the `ImageCache` greatly.
    # In addition, the display of the broken image icon is improved, more
    # closely matching other browsers. A test for this display (which was
    # falsely passing before) is updated to reflect the new display of the
    # broken image icon.
    # Testing: There is a Servo-specific test for this change. Some WPT tests
    # start to fail as well. Before these were not properly loading the broken
    # image icon so they were failing before, just in a hidden way.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40428	(@eerii, #40428)	tools: Use ISO8601 timestamps and filter ports correctly in the Devtools parser (#40428)
    # A recent change in tshark makes it emit timestamps in ISO 8601 format
    # (https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/merge_requests/17273), which breaks the existing parser. Simplify the
    # code to simply print the new timestamp as is.
    # The captured messages were not being filtered correctly by the devtools port, which could result in messy logs. The
    # `-f "tcp port ..."` option filters the port, while `-d "tcp.port==...,http"` just specifies how the messages from
    # that port should be treated.
    # Simplify the tshark command function and some variable names.
    # Testing: Using `mach test-scripts`.

    # Implements the `currentCSSZoom` readonly attribute on the Element interface as

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40375	(@mrobinson, @mukilan, #40375)	script: Let `HTMLCanvasElement` manage the `ImageKey` for canvases (#40375)
    # This change makes it so that the `HTMLCanvasElement` is responsible for
    # managing the `ImageKey` for associated `RenderingContext`s. Only
    # canvases display their contents into WebRender directly, so this makes
    # it so that keys are not generated for `OffscreenCanvas`.
    # The main goal here is that `ImageKey`s are always associated with a
    # particular `WebView`, which isn't possible in the various canvas
    # backends yet. This is important because each `WebView` may soon have a
    # different WebRender instance entirely with its own set of `ImageKey`s.
    # This also allows for clearing `ImageKey`s when canvases are disconnected
    # from the DOM in a future change. One tricky thing here is placeholder
    # canvases, which are meant to be driven from workers.
    # It seems that the implementation isn't correct for these at the moment
    # as they need to be updated to the specification. Instead, what is
    # happening is that any existing context / image is completely lost when
    # converting to an `OffscreenCanvas`.

    # There ~was~ has been a [bug](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/37579#issuecomment-2990762713) in spec. Our
    # workaround has been: for every keyup/pointerup, we remove a corresponding entry in `input_cancel_list`.
    # But we missed one thing: it is possible to only dispatch keydown in [element send
    # keys](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-element-send-keys). In that case, we inserted an entry into
    # `input_cancel_list` but removes Id from `input_state_table` in the end. This causes a panic with a followup

    # Add a `--coverage` flag to `./mach build` and a  `./mach coverage-report` command to use `cargo llvm-cov` to

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40488	(@eerii, #40488)	tools: Update DevTools parser flags (#40488)
    # Rename the `--scan` argument to `-w/--write-file` and the `--use` argument to `-r/--read-file`. This is more
    # aligned with `tshark`'s syntax, and I think it is a more intuitive naming scheme.
    # Remove the `--filter` and `--range` arguments. They are very easily replaced by more powerful tools like `grep` and
    # `jq`. It seems unnecessary to have them in this script (specially when the most useful thing it does is exporting
    # the capture as NDJSON for other tools to process). This fixes an issue with the last message not being exported.
    # Change the default port to `6080`. This matches the current information [in the
    # book](https://book.servo.org/hacking/using-devtools.html#connecting-to-servo) on how to run Servo with DevTools
    # enabled.
    # Testing: Checked with `math test-scripts`

    quality; unsafe as signature vs unsafe as fence around operations
    # This is last step toward enabling the default rustc
    # `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` warning for the script crate. It wraps the
    # remaining unsafe code in `unsafe {}` and removes the line disabling this
    # warning from `script`'s `Cargo.toml`. In addition, two variables are
    # renamed from `v` to something slightly more descriptive.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior so is covered by existing tests.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40490	(@mrobinson, #40490)	script: Handle more `ScriptThread` messages synchronously (#40490)
    # Make the handling of more messages to the `ScriptThread` happen
    # synchronously with the rest of the message handling. Previously these
    # had to be handled first, but the resiliency of the `ScriptThread` has
    # increased such that they can be done inline now. This simplifies message
    # handling.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior and is thus covered
    # by existing tests. In fact, no tests fail with this change which is
    # the reason we can do it.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40491	(@mrobinson, #40491)	script: Rename `ScriptThreadMessage::AttachLayout` to `ScriptThreadMessage::SpawnPipeline` (#40491)
    # The thing that this message does is to spawn a pipeline in a
    # `ScriptThread`. I believe that the `AttachLayout` name is a relic of a
    # different time. The corresponding procedure in the `Constellation` is
    # already called `Pipeline::spawn`.
    # Testing: This is just a rename, so existing tests should cover this change.

    # An implementation detail of `./mach try` is that it creates a git commit containing information about the try
    # configuration. Adding `--no-verify` skips running git pre-commit hooks, which could cause the commit to fail. This
    # is useful for draft / work-in-progress branches, where you quickly want to commit something and test CI works,
    # before fixing lints / formatting etc.
    # Testing: Manually tested with `./mach try`.
    # Fixes: #40475
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40489	(@eerii, #40489)	tools: Remove wrapped JSON message in the DevTools parser (#40489)
    # Instead of outputing `{"_to": "...", "message": {"to": "...", ...}}` the JSON message is simplified to `{"to":
    # "...", ...}`. This is possible since all valid devtools messages include a "to" or a "from" field. These two fields
    # will always be placed at the start of the serialized message, with the rest of fields being sorted alphabetically.
    # Simplify detection of server or client message, removing the need to pass the devtools port when reading a .pcap
    # file. Now the pretty message says "Server" and "Client" instead of "Servo" and "Firefox", which was innacurate
    # when inspecting one instance of Firefox from another.

    # `UnprivilegedPipelineContent` contains all of the data necessary to
    # create a new `ScriptThread` with an initial `Pipeline` in a new
    # process. This change reuses the `InitialScriptState` and
    # `InitialPipelineState` structs inside `UnprivilegedPipelineContent` and
    # renames it to `NewScriptEventLoopProcessInfo` to clarify what it does.
    # In addition, `InitialScriptState` also repeated much of the data of
    # `NewPipelineInfo`, which is now deduplicated and passed separately to
    # the `ScriptThreadFactory`.
    # The overall goal here is to make `ScriptThread` and `Pipeline` creation
    # separate. A `ScriptThread` contains many `Pipeline`s which come and go,
    # so it should not depend on a single creation `Pipeline`. This is the
    # first step toward doing that.
    # Some inputs to `ScriptThreadFactory` differ based on whether the new
    # `ScriptThread` is created in a new process or not. This change makes it
    # so that these input are passed as extra arguments.
    # Finally these changes have revealed a couple members of data structures
    # that aren't used. These have been removed.

    # Changelog
    # Sourced from jiff's changelog.
    # 0.2.16 (2025-11-07)
    # This release contains a number of enhancements and bug fixes that have accrued
    # over the last few months. Most are small polishes. A couple of the bug fixes
    # apply to panics that could occur when parsing invalid TZ strings or invalid
    # strptime format strings.
    # Also, parsing into a Span should now be much faster (for both the ISO 8601
    # and &quot;friendly&quot; duration formats).
    # Enhancements:
    # #298:
    # Add Serde helpers for (de)serializing std::time::Duration values.
    # #396:
    # Add Sub and Add trait implementations for Zoned (in addition to the
    # already existing trait implementations for &amp;Zoned).
    # #397:
    # Add BrokenDownTime::set_meridiem and ensure it overrides the hour when
    # formatting.
    # #409:
    # Switch dependency on serde to serde_core. This should help speed up
    # compilation times in some cases.
    # #430:
    # Add new Zoned::series API, making it consistent with the same API on other
    # datetime types.
    # #432:
    # When lenient mode is enabled for strftime, Jiff will no longer error when
    # the formatting string contains invalid UTF-8.
    # #432:
    # Formatting of %y and %g no longer fails based on the specific year value.
    # #432:
    # Parsing of %s is now a bit more consistent with other fields. Moreover,
    # BrokenDownTime::{to_timestamp,to_zoned} will now prefer timestamps parsed
    # with %s over any other fields that have been parsed.
    # #433:
    # Allow parsing just a %s into a Zoned via the Etc/Unknown time zone.
    # Bug fixes:
    # #386:
    # Fix a bug where 2087-12-31T23:00:00Z in the Africa/Casablanca time zone
    # could not be round-tripped (because its offset was calculated incorrectly as
    # a result of not handling &quot;permanent DST&quot; POSIX time zones).
    # #407:
    # Fix a panic that occurred when parsing an empty string as a POSIX time zone.
    # #410:
    # Fix a panic that could occur when parsing %: via strptime APIs.

    # Adjusted a debug assertion that handled 1-bit code sizes incorrectly in the
    # decoder (relevant for TIFF but non-standard for GIF). In that case the size

    # increasing the screen timeout and manually waking the device up.
    # We add a helper class for that, so that we can use the `with` syntax to undo these changes at the end of scope.

    # Breaking Changes
    # While technically breaking, it's assumed you will not need to do anything or be affected.
    # The HTTP/2 client connection no longer allows an executor

    # This was an oversight originally. The client connection will now include spawning
    # a future that keeps a copy of the executor to spawn other futures. Thus, if it is
    # !Send, it needs to spawn !Send futures. The likelihood of executors that match
    # the previously allowed behavior should be very remote.
    # There is also technically a semver break in here, which is that the
    # Http2ClientConnExec trait no longer dyn-compatible, because it now expects to
    # be Clone. This should not break usage of the conn builder, because it already
    # separately had E: Clone bounds. If someone were using dyn Http2ClientConnExec,
    # that will break. However, there is no purpose for doing so, and it is not usable
    # otherwise, since the trait only exists to propagate bounds into hyper. Thus, the
    # breakage should not affect anyone.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40556	(@mrobinson, #40556)	script: Have `FetchResponseListener::process_response_eof` consume the listener (#40556)
    # The goal of this change is to prevent having to copy so much data out of
    # listeners when a fetch completes, which will be particularly important
    # for off-the-main thread parsing of CSS (see #22478). This change has
    # pros and cons:
    # Pros:
    #  - This makes the design of the `FetchResponseListener` a great deal simpler.
    #    They no longer individually store a dummy `ResourceFetchTiming` that is
    #    only replaced right before `process_response_eof`.
    #  - The creation of the `Arc>` in the
    #    `NetworkListener` is abstracted away from clients and now they just
    #    pass the `FetchResponseListener` to the fetch methods in the global.
    # Cons:
    #  - Now each `FetchResponseListener` must explicitly call `submit_timing`
    #    instead of having the `NetworkListener` do it. This is arguably a bit
    #    easier to follow in the code.
    #  - Since the internal data of the `NetworkListener` is now an
    #    `Arc>>`, when the fetching code
    #    needs to share state with the `NetworkListener` it either needs to
    #    share an `Option` or some sort of internal state. In one case I've
    #    stored the `Option` and in another case, I've stored a new inner
    #    shared value.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior and is thus covered by existing tests.

    # The `seek` method isn't explicitly exposed in the API, but is called from various places (`currentTime`, `fastSeek`,
    # by the `media metadata` event) and doesn't itself create new DOM objects, so the `canGC` argument can be omitted.

    # The `JoinHandle` was added as a newer return value from this
    # constructor. Both return values accomplish more or less the same thing.
    # The difference is that the `Sender` return value is triggered right
    # before the thread ends while the `JoinHandle` is triggered after thread
    # completion. One was used in multiprocess mode and one in single process
    # mode. In any case, the `JoinHandle` works fine for both cases.
    # Testing: Multiprocess isn't tested currently, but I confirmed that the
    # ScripThread shut down properly in multiprocess mode with this change.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40650	(@kkoyung, #40650)	script: Use `hkdf` crate for HKDF in WebCrypto (#40650)
    # We currently use the crate `aws-lc-rs` for HKDF in the WebCrypto API. When generating output
    # bytes from the output of HKDF-Expand operation (OKM, Output Key Material), it enforces the
    # requested output length must match the length of key type (see error condition of `Okm::fill`
    # at https://docs.rs/aws-lc-rs/1.14.1/aws_lc_rs/hkdf/struct.Okm.html#method.fill). However,
    # according to the WebCrypto API specification, user should be allowed to choose the output length
    # (https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#hkdf-operations-derive-bits). The restriction from `aws-lc-rs` causes several
    # HKDF-related WPT tests to fail.
    # This patch switches to use a more flexible crate `hkdf` (https://crates.io/crates/hkdf) for implementing HKDF in
    # our WebCrypto API, and allowing variable length output. This helps to make those HKDF-related WPT tests pass.
    # Testing: Pass some WPT tests that were expected to fail.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40639	(@mrobinson, @vimpunk, #40639)	script: Add support for parsing CSS in parallel (#40639)
    perf
    # This change is a rework of #22478, originally authored by @vimpunk.
    # It adds parsing of CSS in parallel with the main script thread. The
    # big idea here is that when the transfer of stylesheet bytes is
    # finished, the actual parsing is pushed to a worker thread from the Stylo
    # thread pool. This also applies for subsequent loads triggered by
    # `@import` statements.
    # The design is quite similar to the previous PR with a few significant
    # changes:
    #  - Error handling works properly. The `CSSErrorReporter` is a crossbeam
    #    `Sender` and a `PipelineId` so it can be trivially cloned and sent to
    #    the worker thread.
    #  - Generation checking is done both before and after parsing, in order
    #    to both remove the race condition and avoid extra work when the
    #    generations do not match.
    #  - The design is reworked a bit to avoid code duplication, dropping added
    #    lines from 345 to 160.
    #  - Now that `process_response_eof` gives up ownership to the
    #    `FetchResponseListener`, this change avoids all extra copies.
    # Testing: This shouldn't change observable behavior, so is covered
    # by existing tests.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40736	(@mrobinson, #40736)	webgl: Ensure all Surfman surfaces are released properly (#40736)
    # This change ensures that all Surfman surfaces used for WebRendering
    # rendering are released in the WebGL thread properly by:
    # - Moving `WebGLThread` shutdown to the renderer. The renderer starts it,
    #   so it makes sense that the renderer also shuts it down when it can
    #   guarantee that no WebRender painting is currently happening and no
    #   images will be in use again.
    # - Delaying WebGL context release until all WebRender operations have
    #   finished. This ensures that the `SwapChain` is still available for use
    #   in the external image handler.
    # The second point is accomplished by sharing a usage map between the
    # renderer and the `WebGLThread` which tracks whether WebRender is
    # currently rendering a particular context. In addition, once the WebGL
    # external image handler is notified that WebRender has finished
    # rendering, it informs the WebGLThread so that it can released any
    # contexts already marked for deletion.
    # Testing: This fixes very common intermittent crashes when running
    # `/_webgl/conformance` locally. It should reduce the incidence of these flaky
    # crashes on the CI.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40725	(@mrobinson, #40725)	script: Use a `WeakRef` for references to `WebGLRenderingContext` (#40725)
    security; fix use-after-free in WebGL
    # Many WebGL objects refer to a `WebGLRenderingContext` and rely on it for
    # messaging to the `WebGLThread`. This poses a problem, because WebGL
    # objects often need to send a message to the `WebGLThread` during their
    # `Drop` implementation. If the `Drop` is triggered as part of garbage
    # collection, references to the `WebGLRenderingContext` might be invalid,
    # if they were garbage collected first as part of the same harvest.
    # This change makes it so that all of these objects store a `WeakRef`
    # instead of a `Dom<>`. The `WeakRef` is only used if it can be rooted,
    # otherwise a `ContextLost` error is given. In cases where only messaging
    # is needed, a cloned `WebGLMsgSender` is used to perform messages
    # regardless of whether the context is garbage collected or not.
    # This isn't a replacement for #37622, but should make it easier to implement as
    # the `WebGLMsgSender` and the `WeakRef` could be stored in the droppable
    # portion of the DOM object.
    # Testing: This fixes a use-after-free issue which is mainly detectable via ASAN
    # builds. Since we do not run ASAN on CI, this is a bit hard to create automated
    # tests for. I verified that this fixed the issue manually.

    ;api; part of per-webview RenderingContext
    # Currently, a single `surfman::Device` is used for all WebGL contexts.
    # This cannot work when we have multiple rendering contexts. So, extract
    # the surfman `Connection` and `Adapter` into a per-painter data structure
    # (`PainterSurfmanDetailsMap`) and store the `Device` directly in the
    # WebGL context.
    # This patch also modifies the WebXR traits so that the `Device` doesn't
    # need to be explictly passed into most methods.
    # *This is a reland of #40594* with the following changes:
    #   - Do not remove WebGL contexts from the context map before cleaning up the
    #     WebXR layers. The layer cleanup process consults the map.
    #   - When cleanup up layers, be sure to replace the WebXRBridge in the
    #     WebGLThread data structure.
    #   - Allow failing to the Device when processing WebXR commands. WebXR
    #     sometimes tries to access contexts after they have been removed.
    # Testing: Should be covered by existing tests.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40160	(@jschwe, #40160)	profiling: Add abstraction over tracing-rs (#40160)
    # There are multiple motivating factors for this change:
    # 1. `tracing-rs` can and is commonly used for structured logging, to gain understanding in what is happening in
    # concurrent code. We would like to attempt to make a distinction of the performance tracing related usage and the
    # logging related usage.
    # 2. This reduces boilerplate code. We don't have to feature guard every span anymore, since the macro will do it for us.
    # 3. This makes it easier to add multiple options for the trace backend (i.e. exchanging tracing-rs for hitrace on
    # OpenHarmony or System Tracing in Android), or something entirely custom.
    # 4. This makes it easier to add further compile-time options to control the amount of tracing. E.g. a future PR could
    # add options to enable tracing based on environment variables set at compile time. Tracing adds runtime overhead, even
    # if the runtime switch is disabled, so having more fine-grained options to partially enabled tracing could be useful.
    # Testing: Tested manually by building with and without the `tracing` feature. In CI we also build with the tracing
    # feature in the HarmonyOS build. We don't have any automated tests for the correctness / presence of the traced entries.

    # Some unit tests attempt to wait for the WebView to be paint ready before
    # executing. The previous code would wait for a frame ready message from
    # the WebView before running, but this was subject to timing issues due to
    # the frame being sent before the load complete message. This changes
    # makes it so that the WebView explicitly triggers another rendering
    # update and then waits for a frame. It should be guaranteed that the next
    # frame will be one that reflects load completeness.
    # Special thanks to jmunroe on Zulip for investigation into this issue.
    # Testing: This seems to eliminate flaky timeouts on my machine. I ran
    # the unit tests in a loop, stopping if any error (such as a timeout happened).

    # This is the last major change before we can try to implement support for

    # rather than `Servo` (via `ServoBuilder`) as a whole.
    # In the compositor, when registering the `RenderingContext`, if a

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40852	(@delan, #40852)	ci: Use new queue API for self-hosted runners (#40852)
    # this patch enables CI jobs to queue for self-hosted runners by bumping our actions to servo/ci-runners#69, and
    # bumping our runner-select and runner-timeout jobs to ubuntu-24.04 (for better retry support in curl).
    # this should further speed up our builds by allowing more jobs to run on self-hosted runners: if a job would take
    # 5x as long on github-hosted runners, then we can wait up to 80% of that time for a self-hosted runner and still win.
    # for now, though, jobs will queue for self-hosted runners for up to [**one
    # hour**](https://github.com/servo/ci-runners/blob/44317e3cd86c5ff2ef0b08878b90da246bc237da/actions/runner-select/action.y
    # ml#L131-L133)
    # (note that you won’t have to wait if the servers are down). if your request
    # for a self-hosted runner can’t be satisfied immediately, it will look like

    # Release notes
    # Sourced from zerocopy's releases.
    # v0.8.30
    # UPGRADING NOTE: #2804, we invert the order of --cfgs passed by our build.rs script. This will be transparent to
    # cargo users, but if you vendor zerocopy and build it by invoking rustc directly, you will need to update your
    # --cfgs. Assuming you're on a relatively recent toolchain, you should simply stop passing any --cfgs when building
    # zerocopy. For more details, see #2259.

    # This is dead code #40799, as it is never called. Remove the delegate

    # The media engine signals with the `PlayerEvent::EnoughData` event that the media source has enough data and the
    # application should stop pushing more data to avoid excessive buffer queueing and wait `PlayerEvent::NeedData`
    # event to continue.
    # Note that the source buffer size - MAX_SRC_QUEUE_SIZE (50MB).
    # This event is reflecting the state of the media source so the application shouldn't change the media element ready

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40860	(@dyegoaurelio, #40860)	nix: Add FHS wrappers for venv binaries (ruff, pyrefly) on NixOS (#40860)
    # On NixOS, dynamically linked binaries from the Python venv (installed via uv/pip) cannot run directly because they
    # expect standard Linux library paths that don't exist on NixOS.
    # This commit adds FHS wrappers that allow these binaries to run in an FHS-compatible environment at runtime,
    # without patching them.
    # I considered using the nixpkgs versions of ruff and pyrefly directly, or overriding their derivations to match
    # the versions in requirements.txt. However, decided against it because:
    # - Version mismatches between nixpkgs and requirements.txt caused type checking incompatibilities (pyrefly 0.34.0
    # vs 0.23.1)
    # - Building these tools from source in nix is slow and adds significant time to nix-shell initialization (both are
    # rust packages that take quite some time to build)
    # Testing: just improvements to the NixOS development environment, no test needed

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40876	(@delan, #40876)	ci: Remove self-hosted runner timeout jobs (#40876)
    # the runner timeout jobs are a helpful safeguard against bugs (or github infra failures) that cause jobs to not
    # get picked up by self-hosted runners, but all they do is wait two minutes and cancel the run, clogging up our
    # github-hosted runner capacity (limited to 60).
    # this patch removes the timeout jobs, based on the expectation that our CI system is reliable enough to not need
    # that automated safeguard.
    # if you have a build that gets stuck on “Waiting for a runner to pick up this job...”, it may be a bug or a
    # github infra failure. you can cancel the build yourself, but please take a screenshot and report it first!

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40898	(@tharkum, #40898)	html: Update the media player state without delays (#40898)
    # Currently the sequence order of the DOM method calls and the media player API calls is mismatched because some
    # media player operations (*) posted to media task with delayed processing (while should be processed immediately).
    # - DOM (script): pause -> seek -> play
    # - Media: seek -> pause* -> play*
    # Also the associated queued media events can be fired and processed by script somehow (e.g. by calling `seek`
    # in event listener handler) even before the calling of the media player `play/pause` API.
    # To handle it the application will try to update media state (by calling media player API) on each DOM `play, pause`
    # method calls and on some `ready state` changes with checking if the media element can be potencially playing.
    # See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#potentially-playing
    # Testing: No expected testing results changes because there are unexpected `seek completion` signals from the media
    # engine with invalid time positions which are affecting passing test score (by masking false positive results).

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40918	(@mrobinson, #40918)	script: Break the `ScriptThread` dependency on the initial `Pipeline` (#40918)
    # `ScriptThread`s start with an initial `Pipeline`, but that `Pipeline`
    # should not be used for any `ScriptThread` global data as a
    # `ScriptThread` can have any number of `Pipeline`s that come and go.
    # There's no architectural reason why a `ScriptThread` should be
    # associated with only a single `WebView`.
    # This change makes it so that the `ScriptThread` no longer uses the
    # `PipelineId` and the `WebViewId` of the initial `Pipeline` to initialize
    # itself. Instead a `ScriptEventLoopId` is used to uniquely identify every
    # `ScriptThread` in both the `ScriptThread` and the `Constellation`.
    # The remaining use was for crash reporting. Now when a crash happens, it
    # launches the sad tab in all `WebView`s that depeneded on that
    # `ScriptThread`.
    # This is a change which should allow simplifying the way that
    # `EventLoop`s/`ScriptThread`s are started in the `Constellation`, which
    # will be handled in a followup.
    # Testing: This shouldn't change behavior except in the case where a
    # `ScriptThread` is used in more than a single `WebView`, which should work
    # properly now. I tested this change manually by running servoshell in
    # multiprocess mode while causing a panic to happen due to a null pointer
    # dereference. The sad tab appeared after this change, so things seem to work
    # properly still. Testing crashes is tricky with the way we test servo now.

    ;servoshell; towards multiple windows
    # This change is a major re-architecture of servoshell to support multiple
    # windows. Unfortunately it was not possible to do this incrementally, but
    # @mukilan and I did this together so we feel more confident about these
    # changes.
    # The main change here is that now the `HashMap` of windows that `App`
    # has can be filled with more than one `ServoShellWindow`.
    # `ServoShellWindow` is a wrapper around a `PlatformWindow` which can
    # either be headed, headless, or for embedded platforms. Embedded
    # platforms (Android and OHOS) are only expected to have a single window,
    # but there is no reason that more windows cannot be added.
    # There is still a little bit more work to be done in order to fully enable
    # mulitple windows, so this change is just the architectural preparation.
    # This change enables the embedded and desktop versions of servoshell to
    # start to be fully integrated so that the entire `RunningAppState` is
    # shared between them.
    # Testing: servoshell is the test harness so these changes are covered

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40661	(@janvarga, #40661)	storage: Introduce storage coordination thread and infrastructure for parallel next-generation IndexedDB implementation (#40661)
    # This PR introduces a new storage coordination thread, intended to serve as the central point for managing all
    # current and future storage endpoints in Servo.
    # In addition to the new coordination thread, this PR also lays the infrastructure required to develop a parallel,
    # next-generation IndexedDB implementation under the indexeddb_next feature flag living on a separate branch.
    # Testing: Unit and WPT tests continue to pass
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40923	(@mrobinson, #40923)	libservo: Starting removing the multi-document interface API (#40923)
    ;api; remove old multiple webview features in favour of per-webview RenderingContext
    # For a while Servo has while had a somewhat unfinished multi-document
    # interface API that was meant to implement a kind of window manager
    # inside a single `RenderingContext`. This came with some focus handling
    # and a paint order implementation. This code was never really finished
    # and the `WebView` API is moving toward a design where compositing
    # different `WebView`s together is up to the embedder.
    # This is finally possible now that rendering to multiple
    # `RenderingContext`s is supported. In addition, the MDI API interferes
    # with focus handling when `WebView`s are distributed across windows.
    # Given these two points, this change starts to remove the MDI API.
    # - All `WebView`s can still be hidden / unhidden and start in an unhidden
    #   state.
    # - All `WebView`s always have system focus. System focus never properly
    #   interfaced with Servo's internal focus system anyway. A followup
    #   change will add proper system focus integration.
    # - There are still some leftovers from the MDI interface (such as
    #   `WebView`s having their own size). These will be cleaned up in a
    #   followup change. Only the changes necessary to get multi-window
    #   support working are included here.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior and tests are updated for the
    # new APIs.

    ;dom; full support for Argon2 including crypto.subtle.deriveBits("Argon2d"), Argon2i, Argon2id (get key length is an internal algorithm)
    # Finish adding Argon2 support to WebCrypto API, using the crate `argon2` to support the cryptographic calculation.
    # This patch implements "derive bits" operation and the "get key length" operation of Argon2. Actual error messages
    # are also provided for the existing "import key" operation of Argon2.
    # Testing: Pass some WPT tests that were expected to fail.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40944	(@mrobinson, #40944)	constellation: Break the `EventLoop` dependency on the initial `Pipeline` (#40944)
    # Currently starting a script `EventLoop` depends on sending data about
    # the initial `Pipeline`. This change breaks this dependency. The goal
    # here is to:
    # 1. Allow `ScriptThread`s to be shared between `WebView`s. This will
    #    allow more flexiblity with the way that `ScriptThread`s are created,
    #    which should allow us to perserve system resources by allowing them
    #    to be shared between `WebView`s. With this change, we can do away
    #    with the `InitialPipelineState` entirely, which was gather
    #    information necessary for both a new `EventLoop` and a new
    #    `Pipeline`. We no longer have to do many clones when reusing an
    #    existing even loop.
    # 1. Simplify the way that `EventLoop`s and `Pipeline`s are spawned. Now
    #    `Pipeline`s are spawned in the same way no matter what.
    # Now the general order of operations when starting a pipeline is:
    # 1. Get or create an event loop for the pipeline:
    #     - If the event loop needs to be spawn, spawned it in a new thread or
    #       process.
    # 2. Send the spawn pipeline message to the event loop (kept alive via an
    #    `Rc`.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior in a way that is observable, so should
    # be covered by existing tests.

    # This change makes it easier for embedders to embed the types that they
