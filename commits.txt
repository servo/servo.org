    layout
    # The outer display type of a table element applies to the table wrapper box. The table grid box needs to be
    # block-level as defined in https://drafts.csswg.org/css-tables/#table-grid-box
    # Therefore this sets `display: table` on table grid boxes, and then when painting collapsed table borders we can

    tables
    # In #35075 I painted them in front of the decorations (backgrounds and borders) of any block-level box in the same
    # stacking context. I did that because other browsers paint them in front of the decorations of the descendants of the
    # table, but my approach also painted them in front of decorations of following siblings of the table, which was wrong.
    # This patch makes it so that collapsed table orders are painted in the same step as decorations. However, tables
    # defer painting their collapsed borders after the decorations of their descendants.
    # This matches Blink and WebKit, and brings us closer to Gecko (which is slightly different in some corner cases).

    layout
    # A box is usually sized by the formatting context in which it participates.
    # However, tables have some special sizing behaviors that we implemented
    # with a `content_inline_size_for_table` override.
    # However, breaking the assumptions of the formatting context isn't great.
    # It was also bad for performance that we could try to layout a table
    # among floats even though it wouldn't en up fitting because of a larger
    # min-content size.
    # Therefore, this changes the logic so that formatting contexts use some
    # special sizing for tables, and then tables only override that amount
    # when there are collapsed columns. Eventually, we should try to remove
    # that case too, see https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11408

    # 0.99.19 - 2025-02-03
    # Add crate metadata for the Rust Playground.
    # 1.0.0 - 2024-08-07
    # More than 8 years after the first commit and almost 5 years after the 0.99.0
    # release, derive_more has finally reached its 1.0.0 release. This release
    # contains a lot of changes (including some breaking ones) to make it easier to
    # use the derives and make it possible to extend them without having to break
    # backwards compatibility again. There are five major changes that I would like
    # to call out, but there are many more changes that are documented below:
    # There is a new Debug derive that can be used to easily customize Debug
    # formatting.
    # A greatly improved Display derive, which allows you to do anything that
    # thiserror provides, but it works
    # for any type not just errors. And by combining the Display derive with the
    # Error and From derives, there shouldn't really be any need to use
    # thiserror anymore (if you are missing a feature/behaviour from thiserror
    # please report an issue).
    # Traits that can return errors now return a type that implements Error
    # when an error occurs instead of a &amp;'static str.
    # When using use derive_more::SomeTrait the actual trait is also imported
    # not just the derive macro. This is especially useful for Error and
    # Display
    # The docs are now rendered on docs.rs and are much better overall.
    # Breaking changes
    # The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now Rust 1.75.
    # Add the std feature which should be disabled in no_std environments.
    # All Cargo features, except std, are now disabled by default. The full
    # feature can be used to get the old behavior of supporting all possible
    # derives.
    # The TryFrom, Add, Sub, BitAnd, BitOr, BitXor, Not and Neg
    # derives now return a dedicated error type instead of a &amp;'static str on
    # error.
    # The FromStr derive now uses a dedicated FromStrError error type instead
    # of generating unique one each time.
    # The Display derive (and other fmt-like ones) now uses
    # #[display(&quot;...&quot;, (&lt;expr&gt;),*)] syntax instead of
    # #[display(fmt = &quot;...&quot;, (&quot;&lt;expr&gt;&quot;),*)], and #[display(bound(&lt;bound&gt;))]
    # instead of #[display(bound = &quot;&lt;bound&gt;&quot;)]. So without the double quotes
    # around the expressions and bounds.
    # The Debug and Display derives (and other fmt-like ones) now transparently
    # delegate to the inner type when #[display(&quot;...&quot;, (&lt;expr&gt;),*)] attribute is
    # trivially substitutable with a transparent call.
    # (#322)
    # The DebugCustom derive is renamed to just Debug (gated now under a separate

    shadowdom
    # This change involves two things:
    # 1) Adding shadow roots to the list of children sent to the devtools
    # 2) Adding a bunch more node info to the `NodeInfo` struct which is sent to the devtools, so they know which node's
    # are shadow roots
    # I believe sending shadow roots as children is the way the devtools API was intended to be used, but I can't know
    # for sure, since the only info i have comes from reading source code for the node/walker actors in gecko.

    embedding
    # There are a few methods are still difficult to implement without the help of surfman. To simplify the trait methods,
    # all methods that return surfman types are removed. They are either handled by embedders themselves or abstract to
    # simpler types that servo components need. The most noticeable changes are:
    # - Methods related to native surface are moved to servo_glue. The embedder should decide when to remove/replace
    # the surface and it's outside of servo's scope.
    # - Methods required by servo media now return exact media types for it.
    # The other major change is several difficult trait methods that are reuiqred by WebGL and Servo media have default
    # implementation. So they can be optional for users to implement.

    embedding
    # This change adds the second major part of the new API: delegates which
    # have methods called by the Servo loop. When a delegate is set on a
    # `WebView` or on `Servo` itself, the event loop will call into
    # appropriate delegate methods. Applications can implement the delegate on
    # their own structs to add special behavior per-`WebView` or for all
    # `WebView`s.
    # In addition, each delegate has a default implementation, which
    # automatically exposes "reasonable" behavior such as by-default allowing
    # navigation.
    # There's a lot more work to do here, such as refining the delegate
    # methods so that they all have nice interfaces, particulary with regard
    # to delegate methods that need an asynchronous response. This will be
    # handed gradually as we keep working on the API.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35338	(@simonwuelker, #35338)	Implement ServoLayoutNode::traversal_parent (#35338)
    shadowdom
    # Implements ServoLayoutNode::traversal_parent. This fixes common crash related to slottables, currently present on
    # wpt.fyi and in #35261.
    # Previously, the traversal parent of `Text` nodes was incorrectly assumed to always be the parent or shadow host. That
    # caused crashes inside stylo's bloom filter. Now the traversal parent is the slot that the node is assigned to,
    # if any, and the parent/shadow host otherwise.
    # The slottable data for Text/Element nodes is now stored in NodeRareData. This is very cheap, because NodeRareData will
    # already be instantiated for assigned slottables anyways, because the containing_shadow_root field will be set (since
    # assigned slottables are always in a shadow tree). This change is necessary because we need to hand out references to
    # the assigned slot to stylo and that is not possible to do (without unsafe code) if we need to downcast the node first.
    # As a side effect, this reduces the size of `Text` from 256 to 232 bytes, because the slottable data is no longer
    # stored there.
    # For reference, here is the backtrace from the stylo crash:

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35381	(@mrobinson, #35381)	dom: Always replace unpaired surrogates when handling page text (#35381)
    # Background:
    # > JavaScript strings are potentially ill-formed UTF-16 (arbitrary
    # > Vec) and can contain unpaired surrogates. Rust’s String type is
    # > well-formed UTF-8 and can not contain any surrogate. Surrogates are
    # > never emitted when decoding bytes from the network, but they can sneak
    # > in through document.write, the Element.innerHtml setter, or other DOM
    # > APIs.
    # In 2015, Servo launched an experiment to see if unpaired surrogates
    # cropped up in page content. That experiment caused Servo to panic if
    # unpaired surrogates were encountered with a request to report the page
    # to bug #6564. During that time several pages were reported with unpaired
    # surrogates, causing Servo to panic. In addition, when running the WPT
    # tests Servo will never panic due to the `-Z replace-surrogates` option
    # being passed by the test driver.
    # Motivation:
    # After this 10 year experiment, it's clear that unpaired surrogates are a
    # real concern in page content. Several reports were filed of Servo
    # panicking after encountering them in real world pages. A complete fix for
    # this issue would be to somehow maintain unpaired surrogates in the DOM,
    # but that is a much larger task than simply emitting U+FFD instead of an
    # unpaired surrogate.
    # Since it is clear that this kind of content exists, it is better for
    # Servo to try its best to handle the content rather than crash as
    # production browsers should not crash due to user content when possible.
    # In this change, I modify Servo to always replace unpaired surrogates.
    # It would have been ideal to only crash when debug assertions are
    # enabled, but debug assertions are enabled by default in release mode --
    # so this wouldn't be effective for WPT tests.

    #   - Switches to `self.current_y()?.checked_sub(1)?`, which is safe and is easier to understand.
    #   - Moves `create_spanned_slot_based_on_cell_above()` to `TableBuilder`, since `current_y()` is there, and the

    embedding
    # This change exposes a single `InputEvent` type and now there is only a
    # single delegate method for this `WebViewDelegate::notify_input_event`.
    # - Clipboard events are now handled as `EditingAction` inpute events. In
    #   the future this can include things like "Select All", etc.
    # In addition, many parts of the dance to pass these events can now be
    # simplified due to this abstraction.
    # - All forwarded events are handled the same way in the `Constellation`,
    #   though they may carry an optional hit test (for events that have a
    #   `point`) which affects which `Pipeline` they are sent to.
    # - In the `ScriptThread` we now accept these `InputEvents` and use them
    #   everywhere. Now all "compositor events" are "input events".
    # - This allows removing several data structures which are no longer
    #   necessary.
    # - We no longer inform the embedder when an event was handled by a
    #   WebView as that was only important for a MDI feature that will
    #   no longer be so important the full-featured `WebView` API.

    # ### Spec
    # - https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#maybe-show-context-menu
    # - https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#contextmenu
    #   > When the [contextmenu](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#contextmenu) event is triggered by right mouse
    #   button, the [contextmenu](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#contextmenu) event MUST be dispatched after the

    # ### Following up:

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35387	(@mukilan, #35387)	script: fix spurious animation checks to correctly invoke rAF callbacks (#35387)
    # After running an `rAF` callback, if no new callbacks were registered, we send a `NoAnimationFramesCallback` to
    # the compositor to stop ticking animations using video refresh callbacks. This interacts badly with the mechanism
    # to track spurious animations frames i.e. rAF callbacks that don't mutate the DOM. Such 'faked' rAF callbacks are
    # triggered by registering a oneshot timer instead of the compositor callback.
    # The compositor's refresh callback is never enabled back again once a non-spurious rAF callback runs and registers
    # a new rAF callback. If the former callback resets the `spurious_animations_frames` counter, then when the latter
    # rAF callback runs, it will not schedule a OneShotTimer timer for any rAF callback that itself registers, since
    # the counter was reset previously. Hence that third rAF callback that never runs as it relies on the compsitor's
    # refresh callback, which was disabled previously.
    # The current logic also doesn't actually recognize spurious animation frames because the `spurious_animations_frames`
    # counter is updated at the end of the `run_the_animation_frame_callbacks`, effectively meaning
    # `was_faking_animation_frames` and `self.is_faking_animation_frames` will always be the same value but the logic
    # effectively only runs when `(!was_faking && is_faking)` is true.
    # This patch fixes the logic to detect spurious animations frames by moving logic to update the counter to be before
    # the check for spurious frames. It also ensures that the compositor's refesh callbacks is re-enabled once we see
    # a non-spurious callback.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35031	(@kongbai1996, #35031)	implement Touchevent prevent default behavior (#35031)
    # * The status change logic of the `TouchHandler` is changed.
    # The `WaitingForScript` state is removed. TouchAction can be identified
    #   based on the current touch type and numbers of touch points.
    # * Sends current event to script thread along with recognized `TouchAction`.
    # After dispatch event, script thread sends a `TouchEventProcess(EventResult)`
    #   message to main thread. If the event is set to `DefaultAllowed`, the corresponding `TouchAction` information
    #   is added.
    # * After receiving `DefaultAllowed(TouchAction)` message, main thread executes corresponding action.
    # `DefaultPrevented(TouchEventType)` is received. Use `prevent_click` to mark
    #   that the default `Click` is blocked, and `prevent_move` to mark that the default `Scroll` and `Zoom` are
    #   blocked. In this way, all TouchActions implement preventDefault.

    # Adding Notification binding, we can complete the spec later step by step.
    # **Todo:**
    # - Service Worker API
    # - Constructor - Notification show step
    #   - discuss: Emit an embedder event to let the client decide how to show the notification?
    # - Constructor - if the user denies the notification permission, we should abort the constructor
    # - Run steps in parallel
    #   - discuss: Should we implement [parallel
    #   queue](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#parallel-queue) for running theses steps
    #   in parallel?
    # - Fetch and store image resources (image, icon, badge)
    #   - discuss: should fetch in asynchronous, not sure how we can achieve this, maybe abstract and calling `fetch_image`
    #   in `htmlimageelement`?
    # - `data` should call
    # [StructuredSerializeForStorage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#structuredserializeforstorage)
    # - Apply `Object.freeze` to each action when returning `NotificationAction` from `Notificaion::Actions`
    #   - discuss: call `JS_FreezeObject`?

    # up queuing another dialog behind.
    # 2. Authentication dialog does not show up without this work around:

    # - `handle_compositionupdate` method in `textinput`
    # - The handling of `winit::event::WindowEvent::Ime` events
    # What `handle_compositionupdate` does is that it replaces current selection with the text provided by IME and then
    # continue to select the text, therefore whenever the IME provided the latest text it'll be updated accordingly.
    # In order to enable IME event in Winit we'll have to perform a `set_ime_allowed` on the Winit window, which is
    # currently naively done during the initialization of the Winit window.

    embedding
    # Make the rendering model of the `WebView` clearer:
    #  1. `WebViewDelegate::notify_new_frame_ready()` indicates that the
    #     WebView has become dirty and needs to be repainted.
    #  2. `WebView::paint()` asks Servo to paint the contents of the `WebView`
    #     into the `RenderingContext`.
    #  3. `RenderingContext::present()` does a buffer swap if the
    #     `RenderingContext` is actually double-buffered.
    # This is documented and all in-tree embedders are updated to work with
    # this new model.

    # This patch implements the `FontFace` interface, but with some caveats
    # 1. The interface is only exposed on `Window`. Support for Workers will
    #    be handled in the future.
    # 2. The concept of `css-connected` `FontFace` is not implemented, so
    #    `@font-face` rules in stylesheets will not be represented in the DOM.
    # 3. The constructor only supports using `url()` strings as source
    #    and `ArrayBuffer` and `ArrayBufferView` are not supported yet.
    # A skeleton implementation of the `load` method of `FontFaceSet` is also
    # implemented in this patch. The intention is to support some web pages
    # that don't load without this method.

    # Reverts servo/servo#35561
    # All recent tidy runs are failing with:
    # ```
    #  | /home/runner/work/servo/servo/deny.toml:36: detected yanked crate (try `cargo update -p aws-lc-rs`): aws-lc-rs

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35538	(@mrobinson, @wusyong, #35538)	compositing: Move image output and shutdown management out of the compositor (#35538)
    embedding
    # This is a step toward the renderer-per-WebView goal. It moves various
    # details out of `IOCompositor`.
    # - Image output: This is moved to servoshell as now applications can
    #   access the image contents of a `WebView` via
    #   `RenderingContext::read_to_image`. Most options for this are moved to
    #   `ServoShellPreferences` apart from `wait_for_stable_image` as this
    #   requires a specific kind of coordination in the `ScriptThread` that is
    #   also very expensive. Instead, paint is now simply delayed until a
    #   stable image is reached and `WebView::paint()` returns a boolean.
    #   Maybe this can be revisited in the future.
    # - Shutdown: Shutdown is now managed by libservo itself. Shutdown state
    #   is shared between the compositor and `Servo` instance. In the future,
    #   this sharing might be unecessary.
    # This change also allows saving others types of image output just as JPEG.

    # This moves the GL accelerated media setup out of `RenderingContext`
    # which prevents making libservo depend on the Wayland and X11 versions
    # of surfman explicitly. This support is experimental and (honestly) a bit
    # broken. I've confirmed that this works as well as it did before the
    # change.
    # The main thing here is that the configuration, which currently needs
    # surfman types, moves to servoshell. In addition:
    # 1. Instead of passing the information to the Constellation, the setup is
    #    stored statically. This is necessary to avoid introducing a
    #    dependency on `media` in `webrender_traits`. It's quite likely that
    #    `media` types should move to the internal embedding API to avoid
    #    this. This is preserved for a followup change.
    # 2. The whole system of wrapping the media channels in an abstract type
    #    is removed. They could be either mpsc channels or IPC channels. This
    #    was never going to work because mpsc channels cannot be serialized
    #    and deserialized with serde. Instead this just uses IPC channels. We
    #    also have other ways of doing this kind of abstraction in Servo so we
    #    do not need another. The `mpsc` version was hard-coded to be
    #    disabled.

    embedding
    # When the embedder drops the last WebView handle, the webview is destroyed, but the weak handle in libservo never
    # gets cleaned up.
    # This patch adds a step to `spin_event_loop` that cleans up any weak handles that have been destroyed. In theory,
    # checking the strong count should be more efficient than trying to upgrade each handle (only to throw away the
    # strong handle).

    # Rework the `WebViewDelegate::intercept_web_resource_load` into

    # API.
    # In addition, the internal messaging for this is cleaned up. Canceling
    # and finishing the load are unrelated to the HTTP body so they are no
    # longer subtypes of an HttpBodyData message. Processing of messages is
    # made a bit more efficient by collecting all body chunks in a vector and
    # only flattening the chunks at the end.

    # Before `PaintRenderingContext2D` included `CanvasRenderingContext2d` and `OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D`
    # was standalone, but `CanvasRenderingContext2d` and `OffscreenCanvasRenderingContext2D` share more logic than
    # `PaintRenderingContext2D` and each CanvasContext needs handles both on/off screen so it makes more sense to have

    # of `CanvasState` and `PaintRenderingContext2D` to use `CanvasState` instead of `CanvasRenderingContext2d` (thus

    # This is the first step toward moving the WebDriver implementation to

    # embedding API with WebDriver. See [this zulip thread][a] for more details.
    # While WebDriver will be able to use a lot of API commands to do what it
    # is doing now, there will still need to be some "cheat codes" for more
    # gnarly access to `ScriptThread` details. That's why we likely won't be
    # able to remove all WebDriver-specific messages from the API -- but maybe
    # they will be useful for embedders somehow.
    # A couple messages have to change as they depended on `script_traits`
    # types, particularly those that used `WindowSizeData` and `LoadData`. I
    # think this helps to encapsulate the WebDriver commands a bit more
    # though.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35621	(@mrobinson, #35621)	libservo: Move size handling to `RenderContext` from `WindowMethods` (#35621)
    embedding
    # This is the first step toward removing `WindowMethods`, which will
    # gradually be integrated into the `WebView` and `WebViewDelegate`. Sizing
    # of the `WebView` is now handled by the a size associated with a
    # `RenderingContext`. `WebView`s will eventually just paint the entire
    # size of their `RenderingContext`. Notes:
    # - This is transitionary step so now there is a `WebView::resize` and a
    #   `WebView::move_resize`. The first is the future which will resize the
    #   `WebView` and its associated `RenderingContext`. The second is a
    #   function that the virtual `WebView`s that will soon be replaced by a
    #   the one-`WebView` per `WebView` model.
    # - We do not need to call `WebView::move_resize` at as much any longer

    # A recent change, #35538 added the ability to dump different output image
    # formats. Unfortunately, this necessitated adding a file extension to the
    # output image for WPT tests. This had two problems:
    # 1. The original change never landed properly in WPT for unknown reasons.
    # 2. It interfered with the way that temporary files were cleaned up
    #    during WPT runs.
    # This change modifies the image dumping code to fall back to PNG format
    # when there is no valid file extension on the output image and reverts
    # the change made to the WPT runner.
    # Fixes #35635.

    # * TouchSequenceInfo is added to store information about a touch sequence. In order to respect `preventDefault` we
    # may need to wait until the touch handler has finished processing, which may be after a touch sequence has ended,
    # and a new sequence has begun. In the previous code we had just a single state in the touch handler, which would
    # cause issues when receiving back processed events from previous sequences. To avoid this race, we make the state
    # be per-touch sequence
    # * The handling_touch_move attribute is added to the TouchHandler, indicating that the script is processing the
    # touch move event. We use this information to rate-limit the amount of move-events we send to script, meaning script
    # receives one move event at a time. The spec leaves the frequency of sending move events up to the implementation.
    # * The first touch_move event is merged with all following tuch_move events, until we know if moving is allowed or
    # not. This implementation should be improved in future work.

    embedding
    # libservo has a generic “prompt” interface in the form of PromptDefinition (message, response
    # sender, etc), PromptOrigin (whether the dialog is trusted or from untrusted web content), and
    # PromptResult (positive, negative, or dismissed). While this flexibility was needed in the past, now
    # the interface is only used for [alert()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-alert),
    # [confirm()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-confirm), and
    # [prompt()](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#dom-prompt).
    # This patch replaces that interface with a very specific “dialog” or “script dialog” interface that is
    # explicitly designed for those three kinds of dialogs and nothing else:
    # - show_prompt → show_dialog
    # - PromptResult → AlertResponse, ConfirmResponse, PromptResponse
    # - ConfirmResponse has no Dismissed (it was equivalent to Secondary in both spec and impl)
    # - PromptOrigin is gone (all of these dialogs are untrusted)
    # This allows us to encode the DOM-specified default values for when the user agent [**cannot show simple
    # dialogs**](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#cannot-show-simple-dialogs), and (in the future) add document
    # origin details. We also fix the default values for servoshell desktop headless mode and egl unimplemented dialogs,
    # which were incorrectly Ok for confirm() on desktop, and Ok(default) for prompt() on both.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35672	(@delan, @mrobinson, #35672)	Make auxiliary webviews exist in the constellation immediately (#35672)
    embedding
    # To allow embedders to interact with webviews as soon as they are created, we need to ensure that they exist in
    # both the compositor and the constellation before those interactions happen. #35662 does this for the compositor,
    # while this patch does this for the constellation.
    # When a webview opens another webview (via &lt;a target>, &lt;form target>, window.open(), etc), the embedder
    # creates an “auxiliary” webview, which previously went as follows:
    # - script create_auxiliary_browsing_context
    # - libservo AllowOpeningWebView
    # - embedder request_open_auxiliary_webview (→ constellation FocusWebView)
    # - script create_auxiliary_browsing_context
    # - constellation ScriptNewAuxiliary
    # In that model, the constellation may receive FocusWebView before it receives ScriptNewAuxiliary. Now they are
    # created as follows:
    # - script create_auxiliary_browsing_context
    # - constellation CreateAuxiliaryWebView
    # - libservo AllowOpeningWebView
    # - embedder request_open_auxiliary_webview (→ constellation FocusWebView)
    # - constellation CreateAuxiliaryWebView
    # - script create_auxiliary_browsing_context
    # Since these messages are all synchronous and the constellation will have set up the webview before handling any
    # new messages, the webview will always exist by the time we handle the embedder’s FocusWebView.

    css
    # This PR partially implements CSS quotes (#34446):
    # - For non-auto `quotes` value, retrieves the quote data from the property value
    # - For `auto` value:
    #   - Hooks up the `-x-lang` internal property to track the computed `lang` attribute value
    #   - Uses `-x-lang` value to determine current locale
    #   - Finds out the correct quotes data according to the ICU CLDR data
    # It also removes the stale and incorrect UA sheet `quotes.css` that is not used anywhere.
    # Quote depth calculation is out of the scope of this PR and will be left for future.
    # Other caveats:
    # - `-x-lang` doesn't track the browser/OS-default locale
    # - The quotes data is copy-pasted from the [Gecko
    # implementation](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/intl/locale/Quotes.cpp) instead of generated automatically

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35651	(@mukilan, #35651)	bindings: Fix support for interface members in setlike/maplike. (#35651)
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/30151 added support for setlike and maplike declarations in WebIDL, but the
    # tests only validated if generator code worked with 'DOMString' as the key type. The support for interface type as
    # members was broken as `DomRoot` didn't satify the bounds `Eq` and `Hash` needed by the `Key` and `Value` types in
    # `Setlike` and `Maplike` traits respectively. In addition, the splitting of bindings into a separate 'script_bindings'
    # crate had also broken support for this in CodegenRust.py, as the types used within the definition of `DomTraits`
    # were not referenced using `Self::`.
    # This patch fixes the WebIDL code generator by doing a simple string replacement on the return value of
    # `getRetvalDeclarationForType` so that the proper `Self::` is used. I'm not not sure if there is a better approach
    # to this as it seems most logic in CodegenRust.py uses the `D::` prefix that is expected to be available only when
    # compiling `script`
    # crate and not `script_bindings`.
    # This patch also adds the missing trait implementations for `DomRoot` and ensures that the generated code works for
    # both members of primitive and interface types by splitting the existing `TestBinding{Map,Set}Like` interfaces into
    # `TestBinding{Map,Set}LikeWith{Primitive,Interface}` tests.
    # Fixes #35542.
