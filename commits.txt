https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36253	(@UssyMan, #36253)	Add SimulateColorScheme command and script thread handling (#36253)
    # Implements Steps 2-3 of #35867:
    # - Adds `SimulateColorScheme` to `DevtoolScriptControlMsg` for light/dark mode simulation.
    # - Handles it in `ScriptThread` with `handle_theme_change` to toggle themes.
    # Testing: This PR does not require testing because it only adds infrastructure (command and handler) but doesn’t
    # yet integrate with devtools actors.
    # Fixes: Part of #35867 (https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/35867)

    # Part of https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/33616
    # It appears that there is no web platform test for this change (at least I couldn't find any). The flag itself
    # is used to prevent an attack involving service workers - I only implemented it because it was getting in the way
    # somewhere else.
    # To quote the spec:
    # > The above steps prevent the following attack:
    # A media element is used to request a range of a cross-origin HTML resource. Although this is invalid media, a
    # reference to a clone of the response can be retained in a service worker. This can later be used as the response
    # to a script element’s fetch. If the partial response is valid JavaScript (even though the whole resource is not),
    # executing it would leak private data.
    # There *might* be a passing test after https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36221.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36276	(@mrobinson, #36276)	libservo: Remove a couple `EmbedderMethods` (#36276)
    # - Remove `EmbedderMethods::get_user_agent_string`. This is now part of
    #   the `Preferences` data structure, which should allow it to be
    #   per-`WebView` in the future.
    # - Remove `EmbedderMethods::get_version_string`. This was used to include
    #   some data along with WebRender captures about the Servo version. This
    #   isn't really necessary and it was done to replace code in the past
    #   that output the WebRender version, so also isn't what the original
    #   code did. I think we can just remove this entirely.
    # The idea with these changes is that `EmbedderMethods` can be removed
    # in a followup and the rest of the methods can be added to
    # `ServoDelegate`. These two methods are ones that cannot be added to a
    # delegate as they are used during `Servo` initialization.
    # Testing: There is currently no testing for libservo. These changes are meant
    # as preparation for adding a suite of `WebView` unit tests.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36254	(@Loirooriol, #36254)	Turn `CSSStyleRule` into a `CSSGroupingRule` subclass (#36254)
    # Note that `StyleRule` may not have the `CssRules` readily available, they may need to be created. So the previous
    # approach of providing `CSSGroupingRule` with the `CssRules` is no good: it would require writing them in advance,
    # just in case they end up being used.
    # Therefore, this removes the `CSSGroupingRule::rules` field. Instead, they are lazily obtained in
    # `CSSGroupingRule::rulelist()` by downcasting and calling the appropriate method for the subclass.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36278	(@Loirooriol, #36278)	layout: Allow collapsing bottom margins with any indefinite block size (#36278)
    # According to CSS2, the bottom margin of a block container can collapse with the bottom margin of its last in-flow
    # child if `height` computes to `auto`.
    # However, according to CSS Sizing, that was "legacy spec prose" and should be interpreted as "behaves as `auto`".
    # Therefore, cyclic percentages and intrinsic keywords like `min-content` shouldn't prevent margin collapse, because
    # they behave as `auto`.
    # This change aligns Servo with Gecko and Blink, but diverges from WebKit.

    # `WindowMethods` is used by the embedding layer to get information from
    # the embedder. This change moves the functionality for getting screen
    # size and `WebView` offsets to `WebViewDelegate`.
    # This is important because `WebView`s might be on different screens or
    # have different offsets on the screen itself, so it makes sense for this
    # to be per-`WebView` and not global to the embedder. HiDPI and animation

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36341	(@mrobinson, #36341)	constellation: Rename messages sent to the `Constellation` (#36341)
    # Messages that are sent to the `Constellation` have pretty ambiguous names.
    # This change does two renames:
    # - `ConstellationMsg` → `EmbedderToConstellationMessage`
    # - `ScriptMsg` → `ScriptToConstellationMessage`
    # This naming reflects that the `Constellation` stands in between the
    # embedding layer and the script layer and can receive messages from both.
    # Soon both of these message types will live in `constellation_traits`,
    # reflecting the idea that the `_traits` variant for a crate is
    # responsible for exposing the API for that crate.
    # Testing: No new tests are necessary here as this just renames two enums.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36312	(@mrobinson, #36312)	constellation: Stop assuming that the viewport is shared by all WebViews (#36312)
    # The `Constellation` previously held a `window_size` member, but this
    # assumes that all `WebView`s have the same size. This change removes that
    # assumption as well as making sure that all `WebView`s pass their size
    # and HiDIP scaling to the `Constellation` when they are created.
    # In addition
    # - `WindowSizeData` is renamed to `ViewportDetails`, as it was
    #   holding more than just the size and it didn't necessarily correspond to
    #   a "window." It's used for tracking viewport data, whether for an
    #   `` or the main `WebView` viewport.
    # - `ViewportDetails` is stored more consistently so that conceptually an
    #   `` can also have its own HiDPI scaling. This isn't something
    #   we necessarily want, but it makes everything conceptually simpler.
    # The goal with this change is to work toward allowing per-`WebView` HiDPI
    # scaling and sizing. There are still some corresponding changes in the
    # compositor to make that happen, but they will in a subsequent change.

    # Since we switched to using `aws-lc-rs` instead of `ring`, cross-compiling on windows (to non-windows) had been
    # broken. Using the default MSVC Generator results in CMake erroneously being configured for the host platform,

    # This is the last big change necessary to create the
    # `constellation_traits` crate. This moves the data structure for messages
    # that originate from the `ScriptThread` and are sent to the
    # `Contellation` to `constellation_traits`, effectively splitting
    # `script_traits` in half. Before, `script_traits` was responsible for
    # exposing the API of both the `ScriptThread` and the `Constellation` to
    # the rest of Servo.
    # - Data structures that are used by `ScriptToConstellationMsg` are moved
    #   to `constellation_traits`. The dependency graph looks a bit like this:
    #   `script_layout_interface` depends on `script_traits` depends on

    # - Data structures that are used in the embedding layer

    #   dependency cycle between `webrender_traits` and

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36400	(@mrobinson, #36400)	libservo: Move animation tracking from `WindowMethods` to delegates (#36400)
    # This changes removes animation tracking from the `WindowMethods` trait
    # and moves it to `ServoDelegate` and `WebViewDelegate`.
    # - Animation changes per-`WebView` are now triggered in the compositor
    #   only when the value is updated there, rather than right after ticking
    #   animations.
    # - Both `WebView` and `Servo` now expose an `animation()` method, so
    #   tracking animation state actually becomes unecessary in many cases,
    #   such as that of desktop servoshell, which can just read the value
    #   when the event loop spins.
    # Testing: No tests necessary as the API layer is still untested. Later,
    # tests will be added for the `WebView` API and this can be tested then.

    # This starts to enable the fragment cache for all layout modes, except
    # grid. The main tricky bit here is that update points are absolutes and
    # these need to be laid out again in their containing blocks. We punt a
    # little bit on this, by forcing ancestors of update points to rebuild
    # their Fragments. This is just the first step.

    # to run some tests manually later. Behavior is covered by the WPT.

    # Adds support for both the content and the IDL attribute.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35830	(@dklassic, #35830)	feat: Implement display for text selection and caret (#35830)
    # This PR introduces an initial, straightforward implementation for displaying text selection and the caret.
    # This is achieved by passing the selection range and insertion point index down to `TextFragment`, along with
    # the starting offset of each `TextFragment` to determine the proper range for displaying the caret and text
    # selection. Additionally, the `selected_style` was passed into `TextFragment` to specify the background color.
    # During the final build phase, although whitespace is typically ignored when constructing glyphs, we still need to
    # retrieve it to render both the caret and text selection at the correct location. This ensures that whitespace is
    # not overlooked when the `TextFragment` contains an insertion point or selection range.
    # There are several improvements yet to be made, including:
    # - The caret is static and does not flash.
    # - The caret is not rendered when the input field is empty. (I suppose there should be an easy fix somewhere but
    # I haven't found it yet)

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36454	(@TimvdLippe, @jdm, #36454)	Implement "Create a Trusted Type" algorithm (#36454)
    # This algorithm is quite straightforward written in the specification,
    # but leads to some type awkwardness in Rust. Most notably, the callbacks
    # have different types and cannot be unified easily. They also return
    # different string types. Similarly, the returning objects are all unique
    # types and don't have a common denominator.
    # Therefore, rather than implementing it in 1-to-1 fashion with the
    # specification text, it instead uses callbacks to instruct the type
    # system of what to call when.
    # This is further complicated by the fact that the callback can exist
    # or not, as well as return a value or not. This requires multiple
    # unwrangling, combined with the fact that the algorithm should throw
    # or not.
    # All in all, the number of lines is relatively low compared to the
    # specification algorithm and the Rust compiler does a lot of heavy
    # lifting figuring out which type is what.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36443	(@mrobinson, #36443)	compositor: Unify the cross process and in-process API (#36443)
    # Because there used to be two traits exposing messages to the compositor,
    # there were two kinds of messages that could be sent:
    # 1. In-process messages from the `Constellation`
    # 2. Cross-process messages from other parts of Servo
    # Now these two types of messages can be unified into one type. With that
    # done the compositor can simply keep a single `IpcReceiver` for all
    # messages, instead of having to set up a route for the cross-process
    # messsages. This decreases overhead of cross proceses messages a bit, but
    # more importantly solves an issue where Servo would rely on the
    # compositor's cross-process message route after the `Constellation` had
    # called `ROUTER.shutdown()`.
    # This is part of #36442.

    # `CompositorDisplayListInfo` is a large data structure that scales with

    # This PR bumps stylo from [c756a21](https://github.com/servo/stylo/commit/c756a21864709dae8f85c564125bf92440aeaab5)

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36543	(@mrobinson, #36543)	compositor: Unify the cross process and in-process API (#36543)
    # Because there used to be two traits exposing messages to the compositor,
    # there were two kinds of messages that could be sent:
    # 1. In-process messages from the `Constellation`
    # 2. Cross-process messages from other parts of Servo
    # Now these two types of messages can be unified into one type.
    # This is a reland of #36443, which caused regressions due to the fact
    # that messages to the compositor were no longer triggering the event loop
    # waker. This version of the PR splits out just the bits that unify the
    # two APIs, leaving the cleanup of routes in the constellation for another
    # PR.
    # Testing: This is covered by existing WPT tests.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36491	(@jdm, #36491)	Fix crash when enumerating properties of global object (#36491)
    # These changes make our implementation of the enumeration hook for globals [match

    # fixing an assertion failure that occurred in the previous implementation.
    # Our enumeration hook is supposed to fill a vector with names of properties on the global object without modifying
    # the global in any way; instead we were defining all of the missing webidl interfaces. We now do much less work
    # and crash less.

    # `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements can have their own `::marker`
    # pseudo-element. Since this case wasn't taken into account, they were
    # being stored in main element's `::marker` `BoxSlot`. This could cause
    # problems where two layout boxes would try to use the same `BoxSlot`. For
    # now, just don't store the nested version of the marker. Later, we'll
    # need to figure out how to store these layout objects without causing too
    # much memory usage.
    # Testing: This is covered by `/css/css-lists/nested-marker-styling.html`. In
    # addition, we also made a test case that always causes this crash, but since it

    # There is a `WebView` in libservo (new) and a `WebView` in compositing
    # (old). Nowadays, the "real" `WebView` is the one in the libservo. The
    # `WebView` in `compositing` is really about rendering the contents of a
    # `WebView` from libservo. In addition there is also a trait exposed by
    # the compositor called `RendererWebView` which is a way for the
    # compositor to talk to libservo without a circular dependency.
    # This changes does some renames to make things clearer and so that there
    # is One Less WebView™:
    # - `compositing::WebView` -> `compositing::WebViewRenderer` (this is the
    #   same kind of naming as `ServoRenderer`).
    # - `compositing::RendererWebView` -> `compositing::WebViewTrait`
    # Testing: This is just a couple renames so should be covered by existing tests.

    # for these new algorithms they don't work. Therefore, I will align them with the specification by taking in an

    # When doing any kind of query, up until now, containing block rectangles
    # were calculated by walking the `FragmentTree` until the node being

    # walking the `FragmentTree`, `Fragment`s need to cache their cumulative
    # containing block rectangles.
    # This change adds a new `FragmentTree` pass (during construction) that
    # takes care of calculating and caching these values. The new cached value
    # is used during resolved style queries and also scrolling area queries
    # (with the idea that all queries will eventually use them).
    # In addition, extra `FragmentTree` walks used for cancelling animations
    # for elements no longer in the `FragmentTree` are integrated into this
    # new traversal.

    # messages are sent for an entire WebView. This means that each
    # `ScriptThread` will always receive a single tick for every time that
    # animations are processed, no matter how many frames are animating. This
    # is the first step toward a refresh driver.
    # In addition, we discard the idea of ticking animation only for
    # animations and or only for request animation frame callbacks. The
    # `ScriptThread` can no longer make this distinction due to the
    # specification and the compositor shouldn't either.
    # This should not really change observable behavior, but should make Servo
    # more efficient when more than a single frame in a `ScriptThread` is
    # animting at once.
    # Testing: This is covered by existing WPT tests as it mainly just improve
    # animation efficiency in a particular case.

    # We previously ignored the opaque layout data field inside each node when measuring a DOM node's memory usage. While
    # some of the reachable memory was accounted for by measuring the layout's box tree, measuring it via the node ensures
    # that we don't miss anything. Since there are often Arc values involved, this means that the layout-thread box tree

    # This change switches `offsetParent`, `offsetLeft`, etc queries to use

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36623	(@TimvdLippe, #36623)	Support CSP report-only header (#36623)
    # This turned out to be a full rabbit hole. The new header
    # is parsed in the new `parse_csp_list_from_metadata` which
    # sets `disposition` to `report.
    # I was testing this with
    # `script-src-report-only-policy-works-with-external-hash-policy.html`
    # which was blocking the script incorrectly. Turns out that there
    # were multiple bugs in the CSP library, as well as a missing
    # check in `fetch` to report violations.
    # Additionally, in several locations we were manually reporting csp
    # violations, instead of the new `global.report_csp_violations`. As
    # a result of that, they would double report, since the report-only
    # header would be appended as a policy and now would report twice.
    # Now, all callsides use `global.report_csp_violations`. As a nice
    # side-effect, I added the code to set source file information,
    # since that was already present for the `eval` check, but nowhere

    # This is a followup to #36629, continuing to implement script-based
    # layout queries  using the `Fragment`s attached to the `BoxTree`. In this
    # change, geometry queris (apart from parent offset) are calculated using
    # `Fragment`s hanging of the `BoxTree`.
    # In order to make this work, all `Fragment`s for inlines split by blocks,
    # need to be accessible in the `BoxTree`. This required some changes to
    # the way that box tree items were stored in DOM `BoxSlot`s. Now every
    # inline level item can have more than a single `BoxTree` item. These are
    # carefully collected by the `InlineFormattingContextBuilder` -- currently
    # a bit fragile, but with more documentation.
    # Testing: There are tests for these changes.

    # - **scripting_enabled:** Add a `scripting_enabled` method to Document, based on whether it has a browsing context,
    # and set this flag for the parser.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36692	(@PartiallyUntyped, #36692)	Propagate image resolution errors in layout context (#36692)
    # This commit modifies layout context to propagate any issues that occur during image
    # resolution.
    # At the moment, when errors occur during image resolution we propagate None upwards. This
    # hides any potential issues that may be actionable, for example, we may want to avoid
    # trying to load an image that failed to load for whatever reason or has an invalid url.
    # This commit instead propagates these errors upwards to consumers where they may become
    # actionable. This is part of an investigation into #36679.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/35999	(@xiaochengh, #35999)	Rewrite node insertion algorithm to match the spec (#35999)
    # Per [spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-node-insert), adoption of new node should be done while inserting
    # the node. This patch moves the call site of `adopt` to inside `insert` to match it.
    # It also rewrites some existing code to better match the spec without any behavioral changes.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36725	(@Loirooriol, #36725)	layout: Refactor `establishes_containing_block_for_all_descendants()` (#36725)
    # Instead of grouping all the `will-change` conditions together, move each one of them next to the condition for
    # the relevant property.
    # This avoids the need to call `is_transformable()` multiple times, and will also be needed for #35391.
    # Testing: unneeded (no change in behavior)
