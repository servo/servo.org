https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36783	(@sagudev, #36783)	Use backend trait with associated types for 2d canvas backends abstraction (#36783)
    # Current abstraction was leaky and very hard to understand/impl because it was so intervened with actual implementation.
    # Now we generalize both `CanvasState` and `CanvasData` over `B: Beckend`, meaning that every type/method must be part of
    # trait interface (that lives in `beckend.rs`).  Using associated trait types instead of `Box` allows us too remove the
    # need for wrapper types (and `to_raquote()` methods) as we can implement helper traits on (foreign) raquote types.  The
    # only time we actually do dispatch (by enum) is at `Canvas` methods.
    # Implementation now only need to implement all backend traits and helpers.  I tried to restrain myself from actually
    # cleaning abstraction (where possible), to keep this change as much mechanical as possible, but we should absolutely do
    # that as a follow up.
    # Testing: Rust as we only do refactor, but there are also WPT tests

    # `surface()` returns `SourceSurface` which is/was meant as optimization when passing from canvas to canvas (in vello that
    # would be wgpu texture; but raquote does not really have this) while bytes returns something that must impl AsRef (this

    # Previously, spans were partially clamped during layout, but this means that accessing and setting these properties via
    # script wouldn't behave according to the HTML specification.  In addition, the value wasn't floored in layout, so could

    # 0.2.11 (2025-05-01) This release includes new APIs for customizing Jiff's strtime behavior along with a few minor bug
    # fixes.  Jiff's strtime formatting API has also been optimized.  It's about twice as fast as it was.  This release also
    # coincides with the publication of jiff-icu 0.2.0-beta.2, which has support for icu 2.0.0-beta.2.  Enhancements:
    # #338: Add support for the %c, %r, %X and %x conversion specifiers.  #341: Add support for %q in jiff::fmt::strtime
    # (prints quarter of year).  #342: Add support for %::z and %:::z in jiff::fmt::strtime.  #344: Add support for %N in
    # jiff::fmt::strtime (alias for %9f).  #350: Add a &quot;lenient&quot; mode for strtime formatting APIs that ignores most
    # errors.
    # Bug fixes:
    # #328: Document default precision behavior of Display impls for datetime types.  #340: Allow whitespace in more places in
    # RFC 2822 parser (improves spec compliance).  #346: TimeZone::get(&quot;UTC&quot;) should now always return
    # TimeZone::UTC.
    # Performance:
    # #338: Jiff's strftime APIs are now approximately twice as fast as they were.  Performance should be comparable to chrono
    # and time's prebuilt APIs.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36791	(@mrobinson, #36791)	libservo: Add a basic `WebView` API test (#36791)
    # This should allow us to start unit testing the `WebView` API.
    # Testing: This is a test.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36795	(@mrobinson, #36795)	layout: Simplify `PositioningContext` by having it hold a single `Vec` (#36795)
    # `PositioningContext` held two vectors, one inside an `Option`, to differentiate between the version used for a
    # containing block for all descendants (including `position: absolute` and `position: fixed`) or only for `position:
    # absolute` descendants.  This distinction was really hard to reason about and required a lot of bookkeeping about what
    # kind of `PositioningContext` a layout box's parent expected.  In addition, it led to a lot of mistakes.
    # This change simplifies things so that `PositioningContext` only holds a single vector.  When it comes time to lay out
    # hoisted absolutely positioned fragments, the code then:
    #  - lays out all of them (in the case of a `PositioningContext` for all
    #    descendants), or
    #  - only lays out the `position: absolute` descendants and preserves the
    #    `position: fixed` descendants (in the case the `PositioningContext` is only for `position: absolute`.), or
    # - lays out none of them if the `PositioningContext` was created for
    #   box that did not establish a containing block for absolutes.
    # It's possible that this way of dealing with hoisted absolutes is a bit less efficient, but, the number of these
    # descendants is typically quite small, so it should not be significant.  In addition, this decreases the size in memory
    # of all `PositioningContexts` which are created in more situations as time goes on.
    # Testing: There is a new WPT test with this change.  Fixes: #36696.

    # This follows the rules as defined in https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#security-inherit-csp where local iframes
    # (about:blank and about:srcdoc) should initially start with the CSP rules of the parent.  After that, all new CSP headers
    # should only be set on the policy container of the iframe.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36668	(@TimvdLippe, #36668)	Implement all trusted sinks in `HTMLScriptElement` (#36668)
    # As a follow-up to the recent introduction of `script.src` as trusted sink, this PR refactors machinery to also support
    # `TrustedScript`.  In doing so, all trusted sinks in `HTMLScriptElement` are now covered.
    # Instead of calling the callbacks in `policy.createX`, we now have a `TrustedType` enum that specifies which callback to
    # invoke.  Unfortunately we still have the `USVString` vs `DOMString` problem, which is why we need to `.map` twice to
    # retrieve the backing `String` and avoid two different types.
    # Additionally, I saw that `script.text` should have called the "String replace all" algorithm rather than setting the
    # child contents.  So that's also now fixed.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36838	(@jdm, #36838)	net: Fix unit tests requiring default resources. (#36838)
    # When all unit tests are run, the existing feature flag use from net_traits was enough to ensure the default resources
    # are baked into the test binary.  When only the unit tests for the `net` crate are run, that feature flag was not enabled
    # in the build so the tests that require the resources fail.
    # Testing: Ran `./mach test-unit -p net` Fixes: #36837
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36832	(@TimvdLippe, #36832)	Create new image cache per document (#36832)
    # Rather than sharing the full image cache in a script_thread, the image cache is now unique per document.  This ensures
    # that CSP factors no longer affect whether the image is retrieved from the cache incorrectly.
    # To do so, the thread_pool is shared across all caches, but the store is fresh.  Except for the place_holder{image,url},
    # which are cloned.  That's because the `rippy_data` is only available in the constellation and no longer accessible at
    # the point that we need to create the document in the script_thread.
    # Contrary to the description in #36505, the script_thread still has an image_cache for this reason: so it has access to
    # the store and thread_pool to clone it.
    # With these changes, the two CSP tests no longer flake.  Confirmed with running the following commmand:
    # ```
    # ./mach test-wpt tests/wpt/tests/content-security-policy/generic/ --rerun=10

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36876	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #36876)	layout: Use `ServoLayoutNode` directly instead of a generic `impl` (#36876)
    # This makes it so that layout is no longer generic on the node type, depending directly on `script`'s `ServoLayoutNode`.
    # In addition to greatly simplifying layout, this is necessary because incremental layout needs to be able to create
    # pseudo-element styles without having a handle on the original `impl LayoutNode`.  We feel this is a reasonable tradeoff.
    # Testing: No functional changes, so covered by existing WPT tests.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36875	(@simonwuelker, #36875)	Serialize attribute nodes as the empty string (#36875)
    # The existing code asserts that attribute nodes are never serialized.  This is wrong, because you can pass an attribute
    # node to `XMLSerializer::serializeToString`.  Instead, the spec mandates that these are serialized as empty strings
    # (https://w3c.github.io/DOM-Parsing/#dfn-xml-serialization-algorithm).

    # When slicing a blob that is already sliced we should reference it's parent's data instead of creating a subview into the

    # While the vast majority of DOM proxy objects created have a non-null pointer in the handler's extra data field, there is
    # one place we create a proxy object that has a null pointer:
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/8b05b7449d3ceaeb6ae834246012ac04a4f048c6/components/script/window_named_properties.r
    # s#L76
    # .  Before #36818, dereferencing this null pointer was undefined behaviour that was silently being ignored; now that Rust
    # 1.86 adds debug pointer validity checks, we get a panic when trying to dereference it.
    # Testing: Tested about:memory with rustc 1.86.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36917	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #36917)	layout: Resolve canvas background properties during painting (#36917)
    # Instead of resolving the canvas background properties (essentially keeping a possible reference to the ``'s style)
    # during fragment tree construction, wait until painting to possibly find the style on an appropriate `` fragment.  This
    # is possible now because `Fragment` keeps a list of flags with relevant information about the root and `` elements.
    # A benefit of this approach is that styles aren't cached in the fragment tree, which would be problematic for incremental
    # layout.  In addition, the old code was making an effort to transform the ``'s background by the root element's
    # transform.  Only Safari does this and there was a resolution the WG that this should not happen in
    # https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6683.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36978	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #36978)	layout: Add a repaint-only incremental layout mode (#36978)
    # This change adds the simplest kind of incremental layout.  When Servo detects that all style changes only require a
    # repaint, only run stacking context tree and WebRender display list generation.  This means that these kind of restyles
    # do not need a re-layout.  Instead, the existing box and fragment trees will be used and the styles of damaged nodes will
    # be updated in their box and fragment tree nodes.
    # This requires a new style repair DOM traversal for nodes that have had their style damaged.  In addition, careful
    # accounting of all the places where we store style must happen in order ot update those styles.
    # Testing: This is covered by existing WPT tests as it should not change observable behavior.
    # We have created a test case which shows a 50% speedup when run in Servo, even though there still a long way to go to
    # match the speed of other browsers: https://gist.github.com/mrobinson/44ec87d028c0198917a7715a06dd98a0

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36896	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #36896)	layout: Share styles to inline box children via `SharedInlineStyles` (#36896)
    # `TextRun`s use their parent style to render.  Previously, these styles were cloned and stored directly in the box tree
    # `TextRun` and resulting `TextFragment`s.  This presents a problem for incremental layout.  Wrapping the style in another
    # layer of shared ownership and mutability will allow updating all `TextFragment`s during repaint-only incremental layout
    # by simply updating the box tree styles of the original text parents.
    # This adds a new set of borrows when accessing text styles, but also makes it so that during box tree block construction
    # `InlineFormattingContext`s are created lazily and now `InlineFormattingContextBuilder::finish` consumes the builder,
    # making the API make a bit more sense.  This should also improve performance of box tree block construction slightly.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior and thus is covered by existing WPT tests.

    # Combines the 2 time values in the HSTS entry with a single timestamp for expiration.  (9MB savings per list)
    # The previous time representations were based on system boot time which meant that the `hsts_list.json` round trip across
    # boots resulted in completely erroneous expiration times.
    # The preload list is now initialized separately from the public and private lists and shared by both, cutting memory use
    # in half.
    # Overall takes memory use from 64MB for HSTS to 24MB.
    # Expired HSTS entries are now removed from the list when updating an entry and subdomains can be added to a list if the
    # superdomain does not already include them.
    # Testing: New unit tests added Related to #25929 but the next step would be to attempt to use

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36980	(@Loirooriol, #36980)	layout: Inform child layout about final block size (#36980)
    # Before this patch it wasn't possibly to simultaneously support intrinsic min/max sizes and content alignment in the
    # block axis.  For example, block containers only support the former, and flex containers only the latter.
    # The reason is that the final block size was decided by the parent formatting context *after* performing layout, while
    # content alignment is performed *during* layout.
    # To address the problem, this introduces the struct `LazySize`, which contains the data to resolve the final size, except
    # for the intrinsic size.  Thus the parent formatting context can first create a `LazySize`, then pass it to the child
    # layout so that (if necessary) it can compute the final size once the intrinsic one is known, and after layout the parent
    # formatting context uses it to actually size the child.
    # This PR just provides the functionality that will be used by follow-ups, but at this point no layout is using the
    # `LazySize` provided by the parent, so there shouldn't be any behavior change yet.

    # This change adds a shadow-tree widget for `` elements.  It also involves some changes to the way layout interacts with
    # the DOM, because currently all `input` and `textarea` elements are rendered as plain text and their descendants are
    # ignored.  This obviously doesn't work for ``.

    # When multiple WebViews are updating scroll events, instead of taking the list of `WebView`s to avoid a double-borrow,

    # There was a typo in how underline thickness (in pixels) was converted to app units.  It was interpreting the pixel value
    # as an f64 app unit value, which meant that the resulting thickness was 1/60 of the value expected.
    # Testing: macOS does not currently run WPT tests, so it is difficult to test this one.  I have manually confirmed that

    # This way, we don't always set the destination to Document (which is as the spec is written today).  Instead, we set it
    # it in the load_data, depending on which context we load it from.
    # Doing so allows us to set the `Destination::IFrame` for navigations in iframes, enabling all frame-related CSP checks.
    # While we currently block iframes when `frame-src` or `child-src` is set, their respective tests don't pass yet.  That's
    # because we don't yet handle the cases where we fire the correct `load` event.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37015	(@sebsebmc@gmail.com, #37015)	Replace hsts preload list hashmap with an FST (#37015)
    # This reduces the memory used by the preload list to just 1.9MB.  The total memory savings in HSTS from
    # pre-https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/103cbed928b0b9ecd7084b5e9dcab135eca19327 is now 62MB, or 96%.  And in terms of
    # total resident memory is a 7.5% reduction.  The DAFSA/DAWG used by Firefox is 1.1MB so there could be additional gains
    # available but this seems like the best option based on maintained libraries available (I could not find a good
    # maintained library for DAFSAs in Rust).
    # The main trick is this: the FST map API is currently designed to map byte sequences to u64 values.  Because we only need
    # to determine if a preloaded domain has the `includeSubdomains` flag set, we encode that into the lowest bit of the ids
    # in the map.  This way finding an entry in the map directly provides us with the `includeSubdomains` flag and we don't
    # need to keep another mapping in memory or on disk.
    # Updated the `./mach update-hsts-preload` command to generate the new FST map file.  (Not sure if I need to update any
    # dev-dependencies anywhere for this change)
    # This change also replaces the use of "mozilla.org" with "example.com" in the HSTS unit tests to make sure that entries
    # in the preload list do not influence the tests (since example.com should not ever end up on the preload list)

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37047	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #37047)	layout: Split stacking context and display list construction (#37047)
    # Previously, after a layout was finished (or skipped in the case of repaint-only layout), both the stacking context tree
    # and display list were built.  In the case of repaint-only layout, we should be able to skip the reconstruction of the
    # stacking context tree and only do display list building.
    # This change does that, also generally cleaning and up and clarifying the data structure used during this phase of
    # layout.  This opens up the possibility of a new kind of incremental layout that does both repaint and a rebuild of the
    # stacking context tree.
    # On the blaster.html test case[^1], this reduces tightly-measured layout time from ~45-50 milliseconds to ~25-30
    # milliseconds on my M3.

    # Bumps [jiff](https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff) from 0.2.13 to 0.2.14.
    # Changelog Sourced from jiff's changelog.
    # 0.2.14 (2025-05-20) This release includes a smattering of bug fixes, and hopefully a small improvement to the time it
    # takes to compile Jiff.  Also, in this release, when TZ is set to a non-empty but invalid value, Jiff will always fall
    # back to Etc/Unknown when using TimeZone::system().  This differs from previous behavior where Jiff would, in this case,
    # attempt to read the system's default time zone.  This change brings Jiff into consistency with existing Unix tooling
    # like date, and is also arguably a better failure mode.  That is, when TZ is set but invalid, we shouldn't silently fall
    # back to the default system time zone, but instead do something that indicates something has potentially gone wrong.
    # Enhancements:
    # #364: Jiff now falls back to Etc/Unknown for invalid TZ values.  #379: Improve compilation times.
    # Bug fixes:
    # #365: Fixes a compile error in Jiff when only the tzdb-concatenated feature was enabled.  #366: Fixes slow initial
    # Zoned::now() in environments where /usr/share/zoneinfo is on a very slow file system (like CI environments).  #376:

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37069	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #37069)	layout: Move text decoration propagation to stacking context tree construction (#37069)
    # Text decorations have a special kind of propagation.  Instead of propating these during box tree construction, move
    # propagation to stacking context tree construction.  This will allow for using a very easy type of incremental layout
    # when text decorations change.  For instance, when a link changes color during hovering over it, we can skip all of box
    # and fragment tree construction.
    # In addition, propagation works a bit better now and color and style properly move down from their originating
    # `Fragment`s.
    # This introduces three new failures, because now we are drawing the text-decoration with the correct color in more
    # places, which exposes an issue we have with text-decorations not being drawn in relation to the baseline (taking into
    # account `vertical-align`).
    # Testing: There are tests for these changes.  Fixes #31736.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37107	(@dependabot[bot], @dependabot[bot], #37107)	build(deps): bump weezl from 0.1.8 to 0.1.10 (#37107)
    # Bumps [weezl](https://github.com/image-rs/weezl) from 0.1.8 to 0.1.10.
    # Changelog Sourced from weezl's changelog.
    # Version 0.1.10
    # Reverted changes made in 0.1.9 to the behavior of the decoder under non libtiff-compatibility mode.  Trying to read the
    # decoder with an empty output buffer will at least inspect the next symbol and either error or indicate the end-of-stream
    # accordingly.
    # Version 0.1.9 (yanked)
    # Increased decoding throughput by 3—30% depending on CPU and data.  Added {encode,decode}::Configuration as builder types
    # for their respective module.  They can be cheaply cloned.  Added decode::Configuration::with_yield_on_full_buffer to
    # explicitly opt-in to libtiff compatibility.  The decoder will not read or interpret further symbols of the decoding
    # stream when the output buffer is full.  This enables a caller to stop fetching symbols and elide an end of stream marker
    # based on out-of-band length information.  The decoder might otherwise error, trying to interpret data that does not
    # belong to the stream.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37120	(@jdm, #37120)	script: Return global objects for DOM objects in the relevant realm (#37120)
    # DomObject::global is a tricky API because it's used pervasively but has subtle requirements that are not documented and
    # not yet enforced by the type system (#36116).  The method returns the relevant global object for a given DOM object, but
    # that operation is only meaningful if there is an active realm.  We usually, but not always, have an active realm.
    # This change avoids a footgun by following the principle of least surprise.  Rather than making every single caller of
    # `something.global()` both prove that there is an active realm and think about which realm they want active, we implement
    # the obvious behaviour: always activate the realm of the callee before obtaining the relevant global.
    # Testing: Existing WPT coverage is sufficient; this method is called all over the codebase.  Fixes: #37070 #27037

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36721	(@mukilan, @mrobinson, #36721)	Add support for static SVG images using `resvg` crate (#36721)
    # This change adds support for rendering static SVG images using the `resvg` crate, allowing svg sources in the `img` tag
    # and in CSS `background` and `content` properties.  There are some limitations in using resvg:
    # 1.  There is no support for animations or interactivity as these would require implementing the full DOM layer of SVG
    # specification.  2.  Only system fonts can be used for text rendering.  There is some mechanism to provide a custom font
    # resolver to usvg, but that is not explored in this change.  3.  resvg's handling of certain edge cases involving lack of
    # explicit `width` and `height` on the root svg element deviates from what the specification expects from browsers.  For
    # example, resvg uses the values in `viewBox` to derive the missing width or height dimension, but without scaling that
    # dimension to preserve the aspect ratio.  It also doesn't allow overriding this behavior.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37167	(@kkoyung, #37167)	Refactoring `HTMLOptionElement::Text` into iterative style (#37167)
    # The original implementation of `HTMLOptionElement::Text` is recursive, and the program may run out of stack space for a
    # sufficiently large number of iterations.  The patch switches to an iterative implementation, with `TreeIterator`.
    # Note that, instead of the usual `while let Some(node) = iterator.next()` approach, we use `while let Some(node) =
    # iterator.peek()` with the newly added `TreeIterator::peek` function.  This is because the choice of the next node
    # depends on some checks performed inside the `while` block, whereas the `next` function determines the next node before
    # entering the block.
    # Moreover, the `TreeIterator::peek` function is added, instead of wrapping the iterator into `Peekable`.  This is because
    # we will lose access to the `TreeIterator::next_skipping_children` function if we wrap it into `Peekable`.
    # Testing: This refactoring has to pass the existing tests.  Fixes: #36959

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37203	(@Loirooriol, @mrobinson, #37203)	layout: Split overflow calculation after fragment tree construction (#37203)
    # Instead of computing scrollable overflow while constructing the fragment tree, we will now do it later.  In the future
    # this will also allow to only recalculate the overflow without rebuilding the tree when transform properties change, but
    # that's left for a follow-up.
    # Stylo PR: https://github.com/servo/stylo/pull/194
    # Testing: One test is now passing (more investigation is needed), but otherwise this isn't expected to have any effect.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37151	(@Narfinger, #37151)	Constellation can now optionally report memory usage when the page is loaded. (#37151)
    # The constellation can now tell the memory reporter to report the memory to a trace file when a page is loaded.
    # Additionally, we amend the memory reporter to allow a simple message where it will report the memory to a tracing
    # provider (at the moment only OHOS/hitrace is supported but easy extension is possible).
    # I am not sure if this is the right approach or if the embedder should decide to have the memory reporting done.
    # Testing: This does not change functionality of any of the rendering.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37065	(@stevennovaryo, #37065)	Implement Input `type=text` UA Shadow DOM (#37065)
    # Implement Shadow Tree construction for input `type=text`, adding a text control inner editor container and placeholder
    # container.  Subsequently, due to the changes of the DOM tree structure, the changes will add a new NodeFlag
    # `IS_TEXT_CONTROL_INNER_EDITOR` to handle the following cases.  - If a mouse click button event hits a text control inner
    # editor, it will redirect the focus target to its shadow host.  - In text run's construction, the text control inner
    # editor container queries the selection from its shadow host.  This is later used to resolve caret and selection painting
    # in the display list.
    # This will be the first step of fixing input `type=text` and other single-line text input element widgets.  Such as,
    # implementing `::placeholder` selector.
    # Testing: Existing WPT test and new Servo specific appearance WPT.  Fixes: #36307
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37182	(@mrobinson, #37182)	constellation: Wait for canvas thread to shut down before shutting down system font service (#37182)
    # The canvas thread might need access to the system font service before it shuts down.  Ensure that it finishes shutting
    # down before triggering the shutdown of the system font service.  This should avoid issues where canvas tries to access
    # fonts right before shutting down.
    # Fixes: #36849.  Testing: Since this fixes a flaky crash on shutdown, there isn't a good way to write a test for it.
