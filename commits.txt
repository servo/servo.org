https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37002	(@andrei.volykhin@gmail.com, #37002)	htmlmediaelement:  Fix fetch request race on "seek-data" event (#37002)
    # On execution media element load algorithm https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#media-element-load-algorithm
    # we can observe race condition between parallel running fetch requests:
    #  R1: (media element) initial request (see "resource_fetch_algorithm" function) R2: (gstreamer) duration "seek-data"
    #  request (see PlayerEvent::SeekData) R3: (gstreamer) continue on last interrupted time "seek-data" request
    # At time there are only one current fetch context for media element but because resource fetch and cancellation are async
    # operations need to identify (by request id) and skip processing outdated fetch request (fetch listener callbacks).
    # Async load in background sequence (stream content length = 2757913): ``` R1 (seek-offset=0):
    # [------------------------------X] R2 (seek-offset=2757866): [---------Y]
    # 			       AS-****-+++-AE
    # R3 (seek-offset=98304): [----------------Z]
    # 					     BS-****-+++BE
    # R1 (seek-offset=0): [------X] R2 (seek-offset=2757866): [--------Y] (discarded data)
    # 				     AS-****---------+++-AE
    # - A*/B* performed seeks (*** seek lock, +++ flush buffer queue + reset EOS)
    #   (on Gstreamer streaming thread)
    # - X/Y/Z "end-of-stream" events from fetch requests
    #   (on Servo script thread)
    # ```
    # All incoming input data from different requests are mixed and pushed to active media player, plus abnormal behaviour due
    # to intermixed X/Y/Z "end-of-stream" events.
    # To handle it properly we will unblock seek lock on "seek-data" event (on script thread) as soon as possible (GStreamer
    # will be able to flush buffer queue and reset EOS state) and introduce buffered data source to delay pushing input
    # data/EOS event until media player will be actually ready.

    # Allow using ASAN on OpenHarmony by adding target specific configuration.  This also relaxes the version requirement for
    # the clang compiler when using asan, since asan also has runtime checks, which should fail if instrumented code relies on
    # an incompatible libasan version (not tested).
    # Additional comments:
    # - Remove `TARGET_LDFLAGS = -static-libasan` since anyway rustc
    #   invokes the linker, so this flag has no effect.
    # - Enable frame pointers with ASAN, since we are anyway debugging.
    #   It should probably be the default anyway.
    # - We pass the with_asan option also to mach package, since hvigor
    #   needs to know that we are building for ASAN, otherwise it leads to a crash at startup.
    # Testing: Tested manually on arm64 OpenHarmony.
    # Known issues: ASAN increases the stack usage, and this can cause segfaults due to hitting the stack protector on more
    # complex pages.  A follow-up PR could address this by increasing the stack size when compiled with asan in threads that
    # hit this issue.

    # sent](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/35788#top) and
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/36676#issuecomment-2882917136, this PR adds a retry for hit tests with expired
    # epoch in result.
    # Hit tests with outdated epoch mean it is too early to perform the hit test.
    # Solution: retry hit test for the event on the next webrender frame.  The retry should guarantee that:
    # - Keep the correct order of events - Retry time is not too long
    # Test cases: `./mach test-wpt --product servodriver -r tests\wpt\tests\webdriver\tests\classic\element_click\events.py`

    # Bumps [bumpalo](https://github.com/fitzgen/bumpalo) from 3.17.0 to 3.18.1.
    # Changelog Sourced from bumpalo's changelog.
    # 3.18.1 Released 2025-06-05.  Removed
    # Removed the allocator-api2 version bump from 3.18.0, as it was not actually semver compatible.
    # 3.18.0 (yanked) Released 2025-06-05.  Added
    # Added support for enforcing a minimum alignment on all allocations inside a Bump arena, which can provide speed ups when
    # allocating objects whose alignment is less than or equal to that minimum.  Added serde serialization support for
    # bumpalo::collections::String.  Added some missing fallible slice allocation function variants.
    # Changed
    # Replaced extend_from_slice implementation with a formally-verified version that is also faster and more-optimizable for
    # LLVM.  Updated allocator-api2 support to version 0.3.*.
    # Fixed
    # Fixed a bug where the allocated_bytes metrics helper was accidentally including the size of bumpalo's footer, rather
    # than just reporting the user-allocated bytes.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37252	(@Loirooriol, #37252)	layout: Force outside ::marker to establish a BFC (#37252)
    # Even though we were continuing the parent BFC, we weren't updating the SequentialLayoutState to have the correct
    # containing block info.  That caused problem in the presence of floats.
    # This patch establishes an independent BFC, which avoids the problem.  This seems reasonable since outside markers are
    # out-of-flow-ish, and it matches Firefox.  Blink implements them as inline-blocks, so they should also establish a BFC.
    # Testing: Adding new tests.  Some still fail because of a different issue.  Also, adding an expectation for several
    # existing tests that were missing it.  Fixes: #37222

    # The correct way to run Python when building Servo is `uv run python`, unless we are running as a descendant of `uv run
    # python`.  In that case, we can use either `uv run python` or `python` (uv does not provide a `python3` on Windows \*).
    # \* for the astute reader, yes, this causes problems for mozjs, which only tries `python3` unless PYTHON3=python :)))

    # Elements in a shadow tree are not inclusive descendants of their hosts - meaning we should not bubble ranges across

    # Bumps [bytemuck](https://github.com/Lokathor/bytemuck) from 1.23.0 to 1.23.1.
    # Changelog Sourced from bytemuck's changelog.
    # 1.23.1
    # Added a windows-only ZeroableInOption impl for &quot;stdcall&quot; functions.
    # 1.23
    # impl_core_error crate feature adds core::error::Error impl.  More ZeroableInOption impls.
    # 1.22
    # Add the pod_saturating feature, which adds Pod impls for Saturating&lt;T&gt; when T is already Pod.  A bump in the
    # minimum bytemuck_derive dependency from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1 to avoid a bug if you have a truly ancient cargo.lock file
    # sitting around.  Adds Send and Sync impls to BoxBytes.
    # 1.21
    # Implement Pod and Zeroable for core::arch::{x86, x86_64}::__m512, __m512d and __m512i without nightly.  Requires Rust
    # 1.72, and is gated through the avx512_simd cargo feature.  Allow the use of must_cast_mut and must_cast_slice_mut in
    # const contexts.  Requires Rust 1.83, and is gated through the must_cast_extra cargo feature.  internal: introduced the
    # maybe_const_fn macro that allows defining some function to be const depending upon some cfg predicate.
    # 1.20
    # New functions to allocate zeroed Arc and Rc.  Requires Rust 1.82 TransparentWrapper impls for core::cmp::Reverse and
    # core::num::Saturating.  internal: Simplified the library's fill_zeroes calls to write_bytes
    # 1.19
    # Adds the #[track_caller] attribute to functions which may panic.
    # 1.18
    # Adds the latest_stable_rust cargo feature, which is a blanket feature that turns all other features on that are both
    # sound and compatible with Stable rust.
    # 1.17.1
    # Adds #[repr(C)] to the union Transmute&lt;A, B&gt; type that's used internally for most of the transmutations.
    # 1.17.0
    # Makes the must_cast versions of the by-value and by-ref casts be const.  The mut ref cast is unaffected for now (mut
    # references aren't yet stable in const fn).  This increases the MSRV of using that particular feature from 1.57 to 1.64.

    # 1.  Allowing a blocking shutdown mode, which can be used to ensure clean
    #    shutdown, regardless of how the API is used.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37186	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #37186)	script: Allow reflows that do not produce display lists (#37186)
    # This change has two parts which depend on each other:
    # 1.  An early exit in the layout process, which allows for skipping
    #    display list construction entirely when nothing would change.
    # 2.  A simplification and unification of the way that "fake" animation
    #    frames are triggered.  Now this happens on an entire ScriptThread at once and is based on whether or not any Pipeline
    #    triggered a display list update.
    #    Animations are never canceled in the compositor when the Pipeline isn't updating, instead the fake animation frame is
    #    triggered far enough in the future that an unexpected compositor tick will cancel it.  This could happen, for
    #    instance, if some other Pipeline in some other ScriptThread produced a new display list for a tick.  This makes
    #    everything simpler about these ticks.
    # The goal is that in a future change the ScriptThread-based animation ticks will be made more generic so that they can
    # throttle the number of "update the rendering" calls triggered by script.
    # This should make Servo do a lot less work when moving the cursor over a page.  Before it would constantly produce new
    # display lists.
    # Fixes: #17029.  Testing: This should not cause any web observable changes.  The fact that all WPT tests keep passing is
    # the test for this change.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37412	(@mrobinson, #37412)	compositor: Do not allow script to scroll beyond node boundaries (#37412)
    # The compositor was accepting scroll offsets from the ScriptThread without checking their boundaries.  In some cases this
    # could cause a temporary discrepancy with the rendered scroll offset.  This change makes it so that all offset updates
    # for scroll ayers in the compositor do not scroll past the scroll boundaries of the node.
    # Testing: Two new tests pass with this change:

    # Add ThreadSanitizer support to mach (`--with-tsan`).
    # This refactors the current infrastructure to support `--with-asan` to a more generic `Santiizer`.  If the need for
    # adding multiple sanitizers at once (e.g.  address + leak sanitizer) arises, we can easily change the `SanitizerKind`
    # enum to a `enum.Flag` instead.

    # races.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37428	(@mrobinson, @steven.novaryo@gmail.com, #37428)	layout: Store scroll offsets in the `ScrollTree` (#37428)
    # There are currently five places that scroll offsets are stored:
    #  - DOM: A set of scroll offsets used for script.  - Layout: An array of scroll offsets that is used for tracking
    #    layout-side scroll offsets.
    #  - Layout: The scroll offsets stored in the `ScrollTree`.  These are
    #    currently unset and unused.
    #  - Compositor: The scroll offsets stored in the `ScrollTree` mirrored
    #    from layout.
    #  - WebRender: The scrolled offsets stored in the WebRender spatial tree.
    # This change is the first step in combining the first three into the layout `ScrollTree`.  It eliminates the extra array
    # of scroll offsets stored in layout in favor of the storing them in the `ScrollTree`.  A followup change will eliminate
    # the ones stored in the DOM.
    # - In addition the `ScrollState` data structure is eliminated as these are now stored in a `HashMap` everywhere when
    # passing them via IPC.  - The offsests stored in layout can now never scroll past the boundaries of the scrolled content.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior and is thus covered by existing WPT tests.

    # This patch adds support for showing source_content in `Debugger > Source` panel.  This works by handling the clients
    # `source` messages in the source actor.  These source actors are already advertised as resource via the watcher,
    # populating the source list.  We also update the `sources` handler in thread actor for future work in thread debugging.
    # Note: while this PR also adds support for showing worker script source_content, worker has been broken (See

    # We implement this the following way: * Create an iterator with elements whose `name` attribute matches * Create an

    # The spec then asks us if there is more than one element in the list, which we implement by checking whether the iterator

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37487	(@simonwuelker, #37487)	Don't allocate in `Dom::trace` even when debug assertions are enabled (#37487)
    # `Dom::trace` currently allocates a new string when debug assertions are enabled:
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/blob/0f61361e27e6904c51431f96c9550fab9048d220/components/script_bindings/root.rs#L232-L24
    # 1
    # This allocation is very heavy in profiles (~14% of runtime).  While it doesn't affect production builds, these few
    # characters are not providing enough value to justify the cost.
    # This changes the method to instead only use `std::any::type_name`, without `format!`.  With this change, all the
    # string-format related methods vanish from the profile.

    # Follow the ImageBitmap specification and make cropping of the bitmap data to the source rectangle with formatting:
    # https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#cropped-to-the-source-rectangle-with-formatting
    # For now the next functionality not implemented: - image orientation support (such as EXIF metadata) - color space

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37475	(@mrobinson, #37475)	layout: Unify scrollable overflow calculation and include `position: absolute` (#37475)
    # Previously, layout was handling scrollable overflow and srolling area calculation separately, only excluding the
    # "unreachable scrollable overflow region" at the last step.  In addition, `position: absolute` was not included in
    # scrollable overflow calculation.
    # This change combines the two concepts into a single scrollable overflow calculation and starts taking into account
    # `position: absolute`.  Finally, `BoxFragment::scrollable_overflow_for_parent` is converted to use early returns which
    # reduces the amount of indentation.
    # Fixes #35928.  Fixes #37204.  Testing: This causes some WPT test to pass, but also two to start failing:
    #  - `/css/css-masking/clip-path/clip-path-fixed-scroll.html`: This seems to fail
    #    because script is scrolling past the boundaries of the document.  This is a failure that was uncovered by the fixed
    #    element now being added to the page's scroll area.
    #  - `/css/css-overflow/overflow-outside-padding.html`: One test has started to fail
    #    here because now the absolutely positioned element is included in the scroll area, and I think there is an issue with
    #    how we are placing RTL items with negative margins.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37287	(@mrobinson, #37287)	fonts: Start using `fontations` to read font tables (#37287)
    # Use `read-fonts` to read font tables for FreeType fonts.  This is the first step to using fontations throughout Servo.
    # The main benefit here is that we no longer need to provide our own table data structures and we can read tables from
    # these fonts without making copies of the table contents.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior and is covered by existing WPT tests.  I have run some manual
    # microbenchmarks and have not noticed any changes in performance that are larger than the general noise.  This adds a new
    # memory map of the font file for local fonts, but this should be very cheap as FreeType is already doing this internally
    # and subsequent maps should just reuuse the existing memory-mapped file.

    # Highlights from the devtools trigger reflows.  Previously, incremental layout would notice that nothing about the box

    # Forcing a new DL in this case makes reflows that happen *while* there is a highlighted DOM node (which did not change
    # since the last reflow) slightly less efficient.  We could check if the highlighted node changed and only force a new
    # display list if it did, but I'm not sure if `OpaqueNode`s can be compared like that.  It also seems like a very niche

    # Previously, the Constellation would immediately ask the Compositor to shut down a pipeline, even before the ScriptThread
    # finished shutting it down.  This meant that the Compositor might remove a Pipeline and then re-add it if the
    # ScriptThread sent a Pipeline-related message (such as a new display list) in the meantime.
    # This change makes it so that the Compositor waits for both the Constellation and the ScriptThread to finish shutting
    # down a Pipeline before removing its data.  In addition, the Constellation no longer synchronously waits on the
    # Compositor when shutting down Pipelines.  This was important when the Compositor would talk to the ScriptThread
    # directly, but isn't necessary any longer.
    # Testing: This is very hard to test, because it depends on the creation and destruction of many iframes and the
    # particular timing of of all the messaging between Servo bits.  That said, this was tested manually by observing the

    # This pull request refactors existing tracing annotations to leverage the new `servo_tracing::instrument` macro
    # introduced in #36573.
    # Specifically, the following transformations were applied: - Removed `#[cfg_attr(feature = "tracing", ...)]` wrappers.  -
    # Replaced `tracing::instrument` with `servo_tracing::instrument`.  - Removed `level = "trace"` - Removed
    # `fields(servo_profiling = true)` from tracing attributes however retained others like `name`.  `skip type`

    # for some inspiration.  The process is as follows:
    # - when we execute a script
    #   - notify devtools to create the source actor - if it’s an external script, send the script code to the devtools server
    #   - if it’s an inline script, don’t send any source contents yet - devtools stores the contents in the source actor
    # - while loading a new document
    #   - buffer the markup, so we can send it to devtools
    # - when we finish loading a new document
    #   - send the buffered markup to the devtools server - devtools stores the contents in any source actors with no contents
    #   yet
    # - when a source actor gets a `source` request
    #   - if we have the contents, send those contents to the client - if we don’t have the contents (inline script that
    #   loaded while devtools was closed)

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37590	(@mrobinson, #37590)	pixels: Move `Snapshot` and related data structures to `pixels` (#37590)
    # 1.  The `shared` directory is for the "_traits" crates, which will likely
    #    be moved out of this directly at some point and renamed "_api".  These crates expose the API of crates to avoid
    #    circular dependencies.  `Snapshot` isn't really this.
    # 2.  `Snapshot` is essentially a specialied kind of `Image` so it makes
    #    sense that it is grouped with other image-related things in `pixels`.
    # Testing: This should not change any behavior so is covered by existing tests.

    # This is finishing some incomplete cleanup from #33044.  Kitchen sink enum types like IndexedDBThreadReturnType make code

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37509	(@mrobinson, #37509)	script: Get scroll offsets from layout (#37509)
    # No longer store scroll offsets for elements in the DOM.  Instead consistently get and set these in layout's
    # `ScrollTree`.  This more consistently requires layout to run when querying scroll offsets, which ensures that they are
    # up-to-date and properly bounded by scrollable overflow area.
    # Testing: This causes several WPT tests to start passing, and one to start failing.  In the case of
    # `/shadow-dom/scroll-to-the-fragment-in-shadow-tree.html`, I believe the issue is that we don't properly handle scrolling
    # and shadow DOM elements.  Before, the faulty scrolling was hiding this issue.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37522	(@stevennovaryo, #37522)	Layout: Add Debug Print for The Scroll Tree (#37522)
    # Add debug option `dump-scroll-tree` to print the scroll tree that had been stored after each reflow, or log that the
    # scoll tree is not initialized yet..
    # To reduce the coupling, the debug print operation will process the scroll tree node list that have been constructed in
    # the stacking context tree.  It will generate a adjacency list and do preorder traversal.  The order of the tree then
    # will depends on the order of the node in the node list that has been constructed.  Which, in turn, correspond to the
    # declaration order of the nodes.
    # This would help with the analysis and development of post composite queries and its caching.

    # what is considered top-level here (it is not strictly defined in the specification).

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37691	(@Narfinger, #37691)	script: Do not run garbage collection when shutting down a Pipeline (#37691)
    # Removes a GC cleanup step on exit pipeline that took half a second at the end of the Speedmometer benchmark.  As layout

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37689	(@mrobinson, #37689)	script: Properly root nodes with animating images (#37689)
    # This change fixes an issue and makes a few more minor improvements to the `ImageAnimationState`:
    # 1.  Image rooting and unrooted now happens in one step from
    #    `Window::update_animations_post_reflow`.
    # 2.  The `node_to_animating_image_map` is now stored as a shared `RwLock`
    #    so that it doesn't need to be taken and then replaced in the `ImageAnimationState` during reflow.  This should
    #    prevent a hypothetical issue where image animations are restarted during empty reflows.
    # 3.  General naming and idiomatic Rust usage improvements.
    # Testing: This doesn't really have any obvious behavioral changes, because all reflows currently trigger a restyle.  It
    # becomes a serious problem with #37677 and this change fixes the failing test there.
