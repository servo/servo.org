    # In the future, servo components should depend on the generic channels in base instead of IpcChannels to correctly
    # optimize for multiprocess vs non-multiprocess mode.  This reexports IpcSharedMemory as GenericSharedMemory in
    # GenericChannel and changes all dependencies on it.
    # Currently this is only a type/name change and does not change functionality.  But in the future we would want want to
    # use non-ipc things for the data.
    # Signed-off-by: Narfinger

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41588	(@mrobinson, #41588)	script: More thoroughly convert between UTF-16 and UTF-8 offsets in text inputs (#41588)
    # DOM APIs for interacting with selection and text in text inputs `` and `` all accept offsets and lengths in UTF-16 code
    # units.  Servo was not converting all of these offsets into UTF-8 code units.  This change makes it so that this
    # conversion is done more thoroughly and makes it clear when the code is dealing with UTF-8 offsets and UTF-16 offsets.
    # Helper functions are added for doing this conversion in both directions as it is necessary.  In addition, a `char`
    # iterator is added for `TextInput` as it is useful for doing this conversion.  It will be used more completely in the
    # future when a `Rope` data structure is extracted from `TextInput`.
    # Finally, specification text is added to all of the DOM implementation touched here.
    # Testing: This change includes a new WPT crash test as well as a series of unit tests to verify conversion between UTF-8
    # and UTF-16 offsets.  Fixes #36719.  Fixes #20028.  Fixes #39184.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41492	(@Loirooriol, #41492)	layout: Stop splitting inline boxes when they contain block-levels (#41492)
    # We now follow the same approach as Blink: sequences of block-levels in an inline formatting context get wrapped in an
    # anonymous block, which is treated as a line item.  Inline ancestors are no longer split.
    # This means that inline elements will now generate a single inline box, and the box tree makes more sense in general.
    # This will help for incremental layout.
    # This also means that block-level elements will now be properly affected by effects like opacity of filters set on inline
    # ancestors.
    # Recently, WebKit has done some similar work, but without the anonymous blocks.  We might also consider removing them in
    # the future.

    # This PR refactors the `test_site_data` integration test to make its setup infrastructure reusable.
    # The changes introduce a small `WebViewTest` helper and generalize the logic for creating site data for test sites.  This
    # keeps the existing test behavior but makes the setup suitable for upcoming tests for `SiteDataManager::clear_site_data`.

    # This allows the try result comment to notify the user if jobs, which don't block the MQ failed when running try-label
    # jobs.
    # Testing: Tested by adding two `DROP ME` commits, which change the trigger from pull_request_target to `push`, which
    # allows us to test the workflow, while retaining access to self-hosted runners and PR comment permissions.  These commits
    # will be removed before merging, and should be ignored during review.  See

    # Inspector sub-actors (walker, highlighter and page-style) had an overly complicated creation mechanism using `RefCell>`
    # and instantiating these actors afterwards.  Since the client always asks for the three actors and instantiating them
    # isn't that expensive, we aren't saving anything from delaying this, and it introduces unnecessary complexity.
    # For `*Msg`, make inspector sub-actors follow the rest and implement `ActorEncode` instead of manually creating the
    # struct in `handle_message`.
    # Note that this change doesn't fix the issue with navigation/reloading breaking the inspector.  I am planning to send a
    # patch for that, but it is cleaner to separate this refactor and merge it before.

    # Changelog Sourced from jiff's changelog.
    # 0.2.18 (2026-01-05) This release ships a sizeable refactor to the RFC 2822, RFC 9110, RC 3339, RFC 9557, ISO 8601 and
    # friendly format printers.  Specifically, they are now all monomorphic internally (instead of being generic over
    # jiff::fmt::Write) and write to uninitialized buffers.  This improves runtime performance (sometimes dramatically so),
    # and to a more modest degree, decreases binary size and improves compile times.  This release also includes a bug fix
    # where DateTime::MIN.to_zoned(..) could panic.  Enhancements:
    # #460: Improve runtime performance and binary size of RFC 2822 printer.  #461: Tweak behavior of printing min/max offsets
    # in RFC 2822 and Temporal printers.  #462: Export fallible constructors for jiff::SignedDuration.  #465: Improve runtime
    # performance and binary size of the &quot;friendly&quot; duration printer.  #468: Improve runtime performance and binary
    # size of the Temporal ISO 8601 duration printer.  #470: Improve runtime performance and binary size of the Temporal ISO
    # 8601 datetime printer.  #474: Improve runtime performance and binary size of Jiff's strftime implementation.  #477: Fix

    # into a separate `Rope` data structure that can be shared with other parts of Servo.
    # `TextInput` needs to move through text content in a variety of ways, depending on the keys pressed when interacting with
    # a text area.  This change provides a unified movement API in both `Rope` and in `TextInput` ensuring that selection is
    # handled consistently (apart from a few minor quirks [^1]).  This simplifies the code an improves interactive behavior.
    # [^1]: One of these quirks is that the edit point will move to directional end of the motion when collapsing a selection,
    # but only when moving by grapheme or word (and not by line).  These quirks existed in an undocumented way previously and
    # they are preserved with code comments.
    # Testing: This is covered by existing unit tests (updated for the new API) and the WPT suite.

    # Small addition of "on_event" for HiTrace
    # When using the tracing-perfetto backend, servo did trace LargestContentfullPaint, (LCP) but when using hitrace, the
    # traces lacked the LCP.  This was due to the tracing subscriber implementation not handling tracing-rs events.
    # More on `on_event` can be found here:

    # Rather than having each callside specifying the relevant information from the GlobalScope, do this via a trait instead.
    # This would have saved us quite a bit of test debugging since we would often forget to set relevant information from the
    # global context for a request.
    # Now, in the future when we need additional information from the globalscope for a request, we only need to update this
    # method to make that happen.
    # Previously it would also sometimes use `document`, but calling the relevant information on either `document` or
    # `globalscope` doesn't matter, since the `globalscope` defers to the value from the `document` anyways.

    # We would set both the origin of the request as well as the client explicitly for fonts.  Instead,
    # `request.populate_request_from_client` is supposed to initialize that.

    # Follows the spec updates per whatwg/fetch#1903 It now expects the explicit requested and quota fields.
    # Unfortunately that is sometimes difficult to determine, since it depends on a couple of things such as data type and

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41767	(@eri@igalia.com, #41767)	devtools: Remove ActorRegistry shareable and start_stamp (#41767)
    # The `ActorRegistry::shareable` field is a copy of the `Arc>` in `DevtoolsInstance`.  It seemed to only be used for the
    # timeline actor.  That adds complexity to `ActorRegistry` for only one actor (which we aren't even using at the moment,
    # the entire `timeline.rs` is marked as dead code), and it is possible to avoid it by storing the `Arc>` copy directly on
    # the timeline actor when it is created.
    # The same goes for `start_stamp`, it is only used in the timeline and it is ok to have it there instead.  Since (if used)
    # the timeline would have to be created alongside the registry there wouldn't be a noticeable time difference.
    # Rename the field in `DevtoolsInstance` from `actors` to `registry` for consistency with (most) of the other code in the
    # crate.

    # Replace the previously hardcoded "name prefix" strings for actors with
    # [`type_name`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html).
    # Note that we aren't using the prefix directly as an unique identifier, and `type_name` wouldn't be suitable for that.
    # The suffix is an incremental counter shared across all actors, so that alone is enough to differentiate them.
    # The purpose of the prefix is to visually inspect the logs and see what actors are involved.  With this change the prefix
    # will be slightly different: "InspectorActor11" vs "inspector11", but that shouldn't affect behaviour.
    # The eventual goal is to remove `new_name` and force the use of `register/register_later` to create an actor.  This is
    # however a bit more complicated, see #41768.
    # While I'd love to add `base_name` directly to the `Actor` trait, that would unfortunately mean that it wouldn't be [dyn
    # compatible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#dyn-compatibility).  There are workarounds for this

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41851	(@mrobinson, #41851)	mach: Parse URL arguments to `update-wpt` from `sys.argv` (#41851)
    # Instead of relying on the contents of the already-parsed arguments, which may have tried to convert URL arguments to
    # paths, parse URLs from their original place in `sys.argv`.  This is a workaround to the fact that we extend the internal
    # WPT update command to accept URLs of GitHub Actions.  This is a custom Servo extension that has no equivalent to the WPT
    # upstream command.
    # Testing: There aren't really tests for this level of the Servo command line tools.  Fixes: #41728
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41820	(@mrobinson, #41820)	Remove the `vello_cpu` compilation option and enable it by default (#41820)
    # There is currently no way to disable canvas on the whole in Servo, so one canvas backend must be enabled for the build
    # to succeed.  Currently, the Vello GPU backend is much slower than the CPU backend, as it downloads pixels to CPU memory
    # before reuploading them and displaying them.  Fixing that requires allowing rendering Vello GPU contents to a OpenGL
    # texture or some kind of surface that can be represented by an OpenGL texture during display.
    # Historically, the approach that other browsers have taken with regard to GPU canvas is that CPU canvas is used as a
    # fallback until the GPU version can be counted on to be reliably faster.  I think that Servo should take the same
    # approach.  We should always expose a CPU version of canvas and a GPU version.  Embedders should not care about how these
    # are implemented, just that they work as expected and perform well.
    # Testing: This change just adjusts the build configuration option, so no tests are necessary.  Fixes: #40779
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41860	(@TimurBora, #41860)	script/dom: Remove unused creator-related methods from WindowProxy. (#41860)

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41858	(@mrobinson, #41858)	layout: Remove outer `Option` on `BoxSlot` (#41858)
    # This was used before for dummy `BoxSlot`s, but we don't have those any longer, so this can just be removed now.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior so is covered by existing tests.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41854	(@mrobinson, #41854)	mach: Remove limits on the number of Rayon threads (#41854)
    # This limit was introduced for another CI system in 2017 and it seems that tests run just fine without it, so I think we
    # can just remove this.  In addition, this has caused problems for some developers locally [^1].
    # We now also have preferences to limit the maximum number of threads in the thread pool (and have a default set, that
    # prevents spawning too many threads on machine with many cores).

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41853	(@mukilan, #41853)	mach: Upgrade `cargo-deny` and report unknown errors in `test-tidy` (#41853)
    # The versions of `cargo-deny` older than 0.18.6 have a bug which causes the executions of `cargo-deny check` to
    # prematurely fail when reading the advisory db (https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny/issues/804).
    # This error is ignored by `test-tidy` since the error message doesn't have the expected JSON fields, causing `test-tidy`
    # to succeed even when there are valid issues in `deny.toml` or `Cargo.lock`.
    # So upgrade the `cargo-deny` version installed by `mach` to be the latest version and ensure that at least the version
    # with the fix is installed on the system.  Also fix the `test-tidy` code to always fail when the exit code from
    # `cargo-deny` is non-zero.
    # This patch also updates `deny.toml` to include exceptions to allow `./mach test-tidy` to pass.  Some of these need to be
    # investigated separately from this change.
    # Fixes #41845.  Fixes #38945.
    # Testing: Tested locally on NixOS.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41810	(@jschwe, #41810)	CI: Make HarmonyOS build job mandatory (#41810)
    # This job was previously optional, since it doesn't have a fallback to github-hosted runners.  However, this doesn't
    # change much, since in practice if the runners are down, the merge queue will still wait for the job to complete (or fail
    # the job after **24 hours**).
    # > If a job is labeled for a certain type of runner, but none matching that type are available, the job does not
    # immediately fail at the time of queueing.  Instead, the job will remain queued until the 24 hour timeout period expires.
    # See [self-hosted runners reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/self-hosted-runners)
    # On the other side, making this job mandatory, will also check the tracing feature builds fine (at least on ohos), since
    # it is the only configuration that currently uses tracing when building.  This would have prevented

    # Testing: Not required / this is a ci configuration change.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41833	(@mrobinson, #41833)	script: Include click count as the `detail` of `mouseup` and `mousedown` events (#41833)
    # This change improves the counting of clicks for mouse button events by ensuring that `detail` property of those events
    # includes the click count.  This `detail` differs from that of `dblclick` events where the `detail` is always 2.  In
    # addition, it ensures that the click count can increase for mouse buttons that do not cause `click` and `dblclick` events
    # (such as the right mouse button).
    # Testing: This change adds two Servo-specific WPT-style tests.  While this behavior is specified a bit, the details are
    # implementation specific.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41741	(@eri@igalia.com, @mrobinson, #41741)	devtools: Improve serialization and remove mutability from NetworkEventActor (#41741)
    # Now `NetworkEventActor`'s methods take a non mutable reference to self (`add_request`, `add_response` and
    # `add_security_info`).  This actor now has three different `RefCells` inside (`request`, `response` and `security`),
    # which group pieces of data that are updated separately via the public methods.
    # For the actor functionality itself, it now follows Firefox more closely.  In the `resource-available` message it only
    # sends the `*_available` fields (i.e.  `response_headers_available`), deferring the actual data to the `get*` messages
    # (i.e `getResponseHeaders`).  There were also a few slight changes I noticed along the way that I tried to fix.
    # Simplify some repeated logic calculating header sizes and listing cookies.
    # `resource_updates` is updated to use `Serialize` structs instead of manually adding values to a map.  This is more in
    # line with the rest of the DevTools code and probably less prone to future errors.
    # Fix "Resource of network-event is missing a browsingContextID or innerWindowId attribute" error that shows multiple
    # times each time the Network tab is open.  Updated all messages to use the correct browsingContextID.
    # Testing: Manually compared all of the Network tab features to avoid regressions.

    # Changed
    # The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.83.0.  All floating point methods on Duration are now const fn.  All setters
    # on Parsed are now const fn.  The serde dependency has been replaced with serde_core, This reduces compile times by not
    # including unused parts of serde.  Date::from_julian_day uses a new algorithm, resulting in an approximately 16%
    # performance improvement.  This method is used internally by numerous other methods.  util::is_leap_year uses a new
    # algorithm, resulting in an approximately 8% performance improvement.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41710	(@Narfinger, @mrobinson, #41710)	net: Set a timeout for connecting (#41710)
    # This PR sets a timeout for the connecting part of hyper that is configurable via the prefs.  The timeout is currently
    # set to 15 seconds which should be enough.
    # This fixes an interesting potential hang for the following specific situation: - Load a Document that has some
    # subresource (such as images) from a String.  - The subresource is on a domain that a restricted internet might not
    # resolve.  - The connection hangs and does not change the LoadStatus of the document as it is blocked by the subresource.
    # Testing: This fixes issues with the 'test_contextual_context_menu_items' when running with a misbehaving proxy.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41796	(@eri@igalia.com, @mrobinson, #41796)	devtools: Consolidate register/register_later (#41796)
    # Replace `RefCell` with `AtomicRefCell` for structs implementing Actor, making them `Sync`.
    # Consolidate `register` and `register_later` into a single function, removing the need to wait for a loop before
    # accessing newly created actors.
    # Now `ActorRegsitry` has improved locking.  Instead of locking the entire struct, each member can be locked separately.
    # Additionally, since `find` now returns `Arc`, we can `find` and `register` multiple actors depending on each other,
    # since the lock is only needed for the operation and we can keep the reference after that.

    # Changes `LayoutBox::InlineLevel()` to have a raw `InlineItem` instead of an `ArcRefCell`.  `InlineItem` is an enum where
    # all the options already use `ArcRefCell`, so the outer `ArcRefCell` wasn't really necessary.
    # Testing: Not needed, no behavior change
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41879	(@sagudev, #41879)	script: &mut JSContext in `cross_origin_own_property_keys` and `append_cross_origin_allowlisted_prop_keys` (#41879)

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41880	(@mrobinson, #41880)	Remove Servo's custom `Range` implementation (#41880)
    # Servo `Range` type probably predates the `Range` type in the standard library.  The fact that there are two `Range`
    # types in Servo is often very confusing.  The internal type is only used for byte indices in glyph runs.  This change
    # removes the internal generic `Range` in favor of a small wrapper around a native Rust `Range`.
    # It's likely that there are more improvements that could be done here, such as reusing `Utf8CodePointIndex`, but this
    # code is going to change a lot soon and these ranges might soon be replaced with actual glyph ranges.  We are going to be
    # looking to remove `TextByteRange` entirely.  This is just an intermediate step.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior and is thus covered by existing tests.

    # Currently there is still one major usage of IpcChannel in the frame_sender.  This will be a more complicated change,
    # hence, should have extra scrutinee.

    # Testing: Like all GenericChannels, this is mostly type changes
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41852	(@jvarga@igalia.com, #41852)	libservo: Extend `SiteDataManager::clear_site_data` to clear localStorage (#41852)
    # localStorage entries are identified via their associated origins found for the given sites.  This brings localStorage in
    # line with cookies and sessionStorage, which were already handled by the API.
    # Both public and private browsing contexts are included in the clearing operation.
    # The necessary support and testing has been added to the storage crate to clear localStorage data.
    # Testing: New unit tests and a new integration test have been added.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41876	(@mrobinson, #41876)	layout: Store `FontMetrics` in an `Arc` (#41876)
    # This decreases the size of `TextFragment` by 66 bits and also allows sharing empty metrics for text runs without fonts.
    # Many `TextFragments` should share the same font so these 66 bits should reflect reality even though the `FontMetrics` is
    # now stored on the heap.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior so is covered by existing tests.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41744	(@eri@igalia.com, #41744)	devtools: Remove find_mut and make all actors immutable (#41744)

    # only allowing changes through internal mutability.
    # First step in refactoring `ActorRegistry` to make it more reliable, easier to use and less error prone.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41532	(@jschwe, #41532)	servoshell: ohos / android: Decouple initialization and window creation (#41532)
    # We can start initializing servo without needing to wait for the creation of a window.  This allows us to perform
    # initialization of servo itself, concurrently to the app UI thread setting up the app UI.  Once the native window is
    # ready, we can then let servo create the first window and load the initial URL.  This is also interesting in the context
    # of using servo as a webview library, where loading the library / initialising the webview and loading the first url are
    # typically decoupled steps.
    # Note: on the android port the Java code is not touched, which means that we effectively still perform the initialization
    # at the same point in time on android.  The change to call the base servo initialiation from the Java app, can be done in
    # a seperate PR, perhaps by someone more familiar with android than me.
    # Follow-up PRs will add multi-window support, which means that some of the multi-webview related code in this PR has open
    # todos, which will be addressed by follow-ups.
    # Testing: The ohos-port is tested in CI, the android port was manually tested by me.

    # Testing: Not needed, no behavior change
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41906	(@mrobinson, @jdm, @Loirooriol, #41906)	script: Add support for setting the edit point with the mouse in `<input>` and `<textarea>` (#41906)
    # This change updates and implements the old `query_text_index` layout query to properly look for the glyph index of a
    # point within a node's `Fragment`s.  This should work properly with the shadow DOM of both `` and `` elements.  In
    # particular, multiple lines are supported.
    # Caveats:
    #  - `` and `` that are transformed are currently not
    #    supported.  This will happen in a followup.
    #  - For multi-line inputs, we should be finding the text offset of the
    #    nearest line that is within the block range of the click.  This will happen in a followup.
    # Testing: This change adds two Servo-specific WPT-style tests.  These are Servo-specific because the behavior of clicking
    # in text fields isn't fully specified.

    # Make it so that clicking past the end of the text of a multiline input, moves the edit point to the end of that line.

    # Moves the adapter dropping logic from the `GPUAdapter` struct to a new `DroppableGPUAdapter` struct.
    # Testing: No tests added.  Fixes: Partially #26488
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41882	(@jschwe, #41882)	CI: Refactor nightly release process (#41882)
    # This change moves the upload and attestation steps to the nightly workflow.  This results in overall slightly more code,
    # but reduces the amount of code that has access to extra privileges.
    # Additionally, this refactoring will allow to easily change the target repo for the nightly release, i.e.  allowing us to
    # reuse the nightly workflow for our monthly releases in the servo/servo repo (in a follow-up PR).
    # We change upload_nightly to get an additional `packages` parameter, that we use instead of a hardcoded table of expected
    # packages per platform.  `download-artifact` doesn't preserve the whole directory structure, so it would be a bit
    # cumbersome to preserve that.  Since we anyway only use the upload script in CI, we can just directly specify the
    # packages in the CI, which also makes things slightly more flexibel if we want to add new packages or platforms.
    # There are still more improvements to come, specifically also to the `upload_nightly` script, with the goal to minimize
    # the amount of code that needs to be trusted.
    # Testing: Manually triggering the [release
    # workflow](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20996682863/job/60358012404) via workflow-dispatch.

    # Fix caching before the console is opened and stop sending messages prematurely.
    # Fix line numbers not showing in console messages because of a missing `rename_all`.
    # Remove `getCachedMessages` in favour of sending a list of messages as a reply to the `watchResources` for
    # `console-message`/`error-message` in the watcher.
    # Remove `startListeners` and `stopListeners`.  These are legacy methods of watching properties before the watcher actor.
    # It is preferred to enable properties in `supported_resources` in the watcher than to use these messages.
    # Remove `clearMessagesCache`, only `clearMessagesCacheAsync` seems to be used now.  Add a reply to
    # `clearMessagesCacheAsync`.
    # Simplify a bit the structs for console messages and prefer serde's annotations to manual serialization.  Merge
    # `handle_console_message` and `handle_page_error`, and improve the usability of `ConsoleResource`.
    # Fix some fields in console messages.  We are missing `source_id` for now.  This will be easier to add after better
    # support for source actors.  We are also missing stack traces.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41882	(@jschwe, #41882)	CI: Refactor nightly release process (#41882)
    # This change moves the upload and attestation steps to the nightly workflow.  This results in overall slightly more code,
    # but reduces the amount of code that has access to extra privileges.
    # Additionally, this refactoring will allow to easily change the target repo for the nightly release, i.e.  allowing us to
    # reuse the nightly workflow for our monthly releases in the servo/servo repo (in a follow-up PR).
    # We change upload_nightly to get an additional `packages` parameter, that we use instead of a hardcoded table of expected
    # packages per platform.  `download-artifact` doesn't preserve the whole directory structure, so it would be a bit
    # cumbersome to preserve that.  Since we anyway only use the upload script in CI, we can just directly specify the
    # packages in the CI, which also makes things slightly more flexibel if we want to add new packages or platforms.
    # There are still more improvements to come, specifically also to the `upload_nightly` script, with the goal to minimize
    # the amount of code that needs to be trusted.
    # Testing: Manually triggering the [release
    # workflow](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/20996682863/job/60358012404) via workflow-dispatch.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41967	(@Loirooriol, #41967)	layout: Fix interaction of `overflow-clip-margin` and `border-radius` (#41967)
    # The `border-radius` values refer to the border box.  For the purpose of `overflow-clip`, we were just adjusting by the
    # `overflow-clip-margin` offset, without considering that this offset may not refer to the border box (in fact, it
    # defaults to the padding box).
    # To fix it, we need to subtract the border when the offset refers to the padding box, and subtract the border and padding
    # when it refers to the content box.
    # This implies that each axis can end up with a different offset, so this modifies `offset_radii()` accordingly.  And
    # then, `inner_radii()` is no longer needed.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41984	(@willypuzzle, #41984)	[26488] - Moves drop logic to inner struct for GPUBindGroupLayout (#41984)
    # Moves the drop logic for `GPUBindGroupLayout` to an inner struct `DroppableGPUBindGroupLayout`.
    # Testing: No tests added Fixes: Partially #26488
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41982	(@mrobinson, #41982)	layout: Remove an unnecessary borrow in stacking context tree construction (#41982)
    # `fragment` is already borrowed here as `self`.  `fragment` is just passed in order to access the `Fragment` that
    # contains the `self` inside an `ArcRefCell`.  This change removes the unecessary borrow and accesses the `BoxFragment`
    # directly.
    # Testing: This is a small optimization, so should be covered by existing tests.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41983	(@atbrakhi, #41983)	devtools: Fix devtools source content being empty for small documents (#41983)
    # When the network decoder's `finish()` returns decoded content in `parse_sync`, it was being added to the parsing input
    # but not captured for devtools.  This ensures the content is also captured for the devtools Sources panel.
    # Testing: We have tests for this in devtools_tests.py.  They were failing before this change.  I ran locally and it
    # passed now.  With this all DevTools tests are passing!
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41971	(@sagudev, #41971)	script: Update mozjs to include with more safe wrappers and debugmozjs artifacts (#41971)
    # This bump includes some new safe wrappers: https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/699
    # https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/700 debugmozjs artifacts: https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/544 rooted macros with
    # vectors: https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/697
    # Testing: Done in mozjs repo.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41964	(@cpedraza@unal.edu.co, #41964)	script: Add error messages for cSHAKE and HKDF (#41964)
    # Add all the missing error messages for `hkdf_operation.rs` and `cshake_operation.rs` (one message only).  Tried to
    # follow the style of existing messages and used an existing message for the HKDF-expand operation.  Related to #40756.
    # Testing: No tests added.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41931	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #41931)	layout: Properly account for transforms when finding glyph index (#41931)
    # This change makes it so that tranforms (including CSS transform and scrolling) are properly accounted for when
    # calculating glyph indices.  Containing block sizes are moved to `BaseFragment`.  This should reduce the size of the
    # StackingContextTree a little.
    # Testing: A Servo-specific WPT-style test is added for this change.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42015	(@Loirooriol, #42015)	layout: Reduce visibility in `components/layout/flow/inline/mod.rs` (#42015)
    # Various methods, structs and fields were unnecessarily public.  Make them private.
    # Testing: Not needed, no behavior change.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42013	(@mrobinson, #42013)	script: Set `MouseEvent` properties according to the UI Events specification (#42013)
    # The UI Events specification has a table of UIEvents which describes the properties that they must have.  Importantly,
    # this includes whether the event should bubble, be cancelable, and be composed.  The code was not following this
    # specification, so this changes centralizes where they are set.
    # In addition, it makes the code that finds the event target consistent with whether or not it is `ShadowIncluding`.
    # Finally the `MouseEvent` constructors are renamed so that it is clear what they are used for.
    # Testing: This change causes one WPT test to start passing.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42007	(@eri@igalia.com, @atbrakhi, @jdm, #42007)	devtools: Handle pause in the debugger (#42007)
    # Add an event listener for `pause` to `debugger.js` and the necessary glue to access it from the `devtools` crate.  This
    # returns important information to know where we are paused, such as the source location and frame state.
    # Fix frame and object actor encoding into messages.  Use information from `debugger.js` to correctly fill the fields.
    # Add a new `frames` list to the thread actor and handle the `frames` message.
    # Fix `getEnvironment` reply in the frame actor.  It is out of form (has a `type` field but it doesn't require a followup
    # empty message, it already counts as a reply), so we need to handle it specially.
    # Note: For now we are focusing on the protocol side of the debugger, and this patch only shows where the pause would
    # happen.  Pausing Servo itself will happen in a followup.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42012	(@mrobinson, #42012)	fonts: Store `ByteIndex` as a `usize` (#42012)
    # This value is supposed to represent a UTF-8 code point offset or length.  It should never be negative and we often need
    # to convert it to a `usize`, so we can store it as a `usize`.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior so existing tests should suffice.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42006	(@eri@igalia.com, #42006)	devtools: Fix failures in `mach test-devtools` (#42006)
    # Make the `start` and `end` parameters in `getBreakpointPositionsCompressed` optional.
    # Send a resource array even if it is empty.
    # Testing: Ran `mach test-devtools`.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41978	(@mrobinson, #41978)	script: Consider a selection collapsed when the edit point equals the selection origin (#41978)
    # In text inputs, the edit point can be equal to a non-`None` selection origin for a variety of reasons such as when the
    # selection is set by a DOM API or when a composition event inserts a zero length string.  In both of these cases, we
    # should treat the selection as collapsed.  It is important to do this because for the purposes of arrow key movement and
    # context menu entries, we should think of the text input as not having a selection at all.
    # Testing: This change adds a Servo-specific WPT test, as key press behavior is platform specific.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40761	(@rodion.borovyk@gmail.com, #40761)	layout: Accept lengths in arbitrary units for SVG width and height (#40761)
    # Previously it was only possible to set width and height of SVG elements in pixels.  These changes allow parsing other
    # units like em using a CSS parser in SVGSVGElement and resolving them to computed values in the layout code.
    # Testing: Tested manually Fixes: -
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42008	(@Loirooriol, #42008)	layout: Simplify `process_soft_wrap_opportunity()` (#42008)
    # Some of its logic can just be replaced with a call to the method `unbreakable_segment_fits_on_line()`.
    # Testing: Not needed, no behavior change
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41062	(@delan, #41062)	ci: Run WPT jobs on self-hosted runners (#41062)
    # this patch enables WPT runs to use self-hosted runners, using the changes in servo/ci-runners#90, servo/ci-runners#91,
    # servo/ci-runners#92, and servo/ci-runners#93 (see servo/ci-runners#21 for more details).
    # fallback to GitHub-hosted runners is included for now, but we can use three self-hosted runners to do what required
    # twenty GitHub-hosted runners in the same amount of time (20 minutes).  in the future, we may be able to run WPT faster
    # than that by decreasing --timeout-multiplier or further increasing --processes, if we fix the flakes.

    # winit on macOS seems to send a mousemove event right before mouse button up events.  This interferes with interactive
    # use of text boxes -- for instance double-clicking to select the hovered word.  This change makes it so that mouse move

    # This change moves the upload and attestation steps to the nightly workflow.  This results in overall slightly more code,
    # but reduces the amount of code that has access to extra privileges.
    # Additionally, this refactoring will allow to easily change the target repo for the nightly release, i.e.  allowing us to

    # We change upload_nightly to get an additional `packages` parameter, that we use instead of a hardcoded table of expected
    # packages per platform.  `download-artifact` doesn't preserve the whole directory structure, so it would be a bit
    # cumbersome to preserve that.  Since we anyway only use the upload script in CI, we can just directly specify the
    # packages in the CI, which also makes things slightly more flexibel if we want to add new packages or platforms.
    # There are still more improvements to come, specifically also to the `upload_nightly` script, with the goal to minimize
    # the amount of code that needs to be trusted.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41965	(@jdm, #41965)	net: Convert blocking embedder communication to async (#41965)
    # #41857 exposed some more code in the net crate that performed blocking communication with the embedder and could prevent
    # other networking tasks from running.  To address that, we need the net code to perform async receive operations, which
    # requires passing tokio channels to the embedder.
    # However, the current embedding message design puts all messages in the same enum and requires that they are
    # serializable.  Embedder messages from the network do not require this property, since they run in the same process as
    # the embedder.  Therefore, this PR creates a new EmbedderProxy structure that is generic over the message, allowing each
    # component of Servo to use a embedder message type that is specific to that component.
    # The final benefit of this set of changes is that the embedder messages for a particular crate can now live in the crate
    # itself (since the only crate that depends on it is the servo crate), not in the shared `embedding_traits` crate.  This
    # hugely reduces the amount of code that needs to be rebuilt when changing these messages, enabling much faster
    # incremental builds for those changes.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42049	(@mrobinson, #42049)	script: Allow selecting text in input fields with the mouse (#42049)
    # This change adds basic support for selecting text via dragging the mouse in text inputs.  This is currently handled
    # entirely inside of text inputs, but will be integrated into a more global drag handler when that is implemented in the
    # `DocumentEventHandler`.  This means that events that happen outside of the text input currently don't update the
    # selection.
    # Testing: This adds Servo-specific WPT-style tests.  There are WPT tests that test this sort of behavior, but I believe
    # they rely on selection events, which we have no implemented yet (we will soon).
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42057	(@honk@goose.icu, #42057)	script: Fix unneeded .to_owned() (#42057)

    # Testing: `./mach build --use-crown`
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41861	(@jschwe, #41861)	mach: Use `uv` to manage the virtual environment (#41861)
    # Instead of attempting to manage the virtual environment ourselves, use `uv` to manage the installation of dependencies.
    # Since we still have dependencies coming from upstream wpt, we use `[tool.setuptool]` in our pyproject.toml to ensure
    # that `uv` dynamically installs our dependencies according to the requirements.txt files.
    # Additionally, this PR also reverts `--no-project` usage.  `--no-project` was added as a temporary workaround in
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37741.  It's not 100% clear to me what exactly the issue was, but
    # [apparently](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37741#pullrequestreview-2985666234) the issue caused the build to
    # break.  Removing the arg seems to work fine, except that we get a warning about a missing `requiress-python` value in
    # `pyproject.toml`.  Apparently it is good practice to specify the requirement as `>=` in th pyroject, and lock the exact
    # version via `uv pin` (which writes to `.python_version`, where we already pin 3.11.
    # Testing: Should be covered by existing tests, which compile code on all platforms.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41932	(@jschwe, #41932)	Further release workflow improvements (#41932)
    # - Allowing overriding the target repository, to allow generating regular servo releases directly - Releases to
    # servo/servo require manual publishing (policy decision) - Generate artifact attestation for the remaining artifacts.  -
    # Remove unused `GITHUB_HOMEBREW_TOKEN` secret - Since getting the names of release artifacts right, and keeping them in
    # sync can be error-prone, we now use artifact-ids and pass them around via `outputs`, so we can't accidentally get the
    # artifact name wrong.  - Fix a deprecation warning in `upload_nightly.py` by explicitly creating an `Auth.Token` object,
    # instead of just passing the token as a string.  - We can't use `${{ env.RELEASE_REPO }}` when calling the reusable
    # upload_release.yml workflow, so we need to copy the expression.  - To be able to use the github token to upload releases
    # to servo/servo (without adding another secret, which could be leaked), we need to add `permissions: content: write` to
    # the release job.  The nightly job doesn't need this permission, hence there is some unfortunate duplication.  This
    # should be improved in future work, where we can refactor the upload_python script, to support uploading all artifacts
    # from a single job, instead of one per platform as we have now.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42105	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #42105)	fonts: Store shaping output per-character rather than per-code point (#42105)
    # This change is a reworking of the shaping code and simplification of the `GlyphRun` data structure.
    # The shaper was written between 2012 and 2014 against an early version of Rust.  It was originally written to have a
    # single glyph entry per UTF-8 code point.  This is useful when you always need to iterate through glyphs based on UTF-8
    # code points.  Unfortunately, this required a tri-level data structure to hold detailed glyphs and meant that CJK
    # characters took over 3x the memory usage of ASCII characters.  In addition, iterating through glyphs (the most common
    # and basic operation on shaped text) required doing a lookup involving a binary search for detailed glyphs (ones that had
    # large advances or mapped to more or less than a single UTF-8 code point).
    # The new design of the `GlyphStore` is instead based on `chars` in the input string.  These are tracked during layout so
    # that the resulting glyph output can be interpreted relatively to its original character offset in the containing IFC.
    # We are already dealing with IFC text on a per-character basis for a variety of reasons (such as text transformation and
    # whitespace collapse).  In addition, we will now able to implement mapping between the character offsets before and after
    # layout transformations of the original DOM string.
    # Now the penalty of more complex glyph iteration is only paid when transforming glyph offsets to character offsets.
    # Currently this is only done for selections and clicking in text boxes, both of which are much less common than layout.
    # This change does not properly handle selections in RTL text, though rendering and basic selection and visual movement
    # works (though buggy).
    # It does not seem like this affects the performance of shaping based on measurement using the text shaping performance
    # counters.  This likely means that the performance of shaping is dominated on our machines by HarfBuzz.  We noticed no
    # performance degradation in Speedometer when run on a M3 Mac.
    # Followup work:
    #  - Properly handle selection in RTL text.  - Support mapping from original DOM character offsets to offsets in
    #    layout after text transformation and whitespace collapse.  This is now possible.
    # Testing: This causes some tests to pass and a few to fail.  This is likely due to the fact that we are handling glyphs
    # more consistently while shaping.  Of the new failures:
    #  - `letter-spacing-bengali-yaphala-001.html`, `letter-spacing-cursive-001.html`, `font-feature-settings-tibetan.html`
    #  where passing before probably because we were not applying letter spacing to detailed glyphs.  These scripts should not
    #  have letter spacing applied to them, because they are cursive -- which we never implemented properly.  It will be
    #  handled in a a followup.  - `shaping-arabic-diacritics-001.html`: This was a false pass.  The tests verifies that
    #  Arabic diacritics are applied to NBSP.  This wasn't happening before nor after this change, but the results matched
    #  anyway.  Now they don't, but before and after are equally broken.  -

    # Parsed and vectorized representations of SVGs in the image cache are never evicted when SVGs are updated, leading to
    # stale SVGs staying in the image cache alongside updated ones.  This PR: - adds a stringified uuid field to SVGSVGElement
    # - adds a map of `SVGSVGElement` uuid to `PendingImageId` in `ImageCacheImpl` - adds an optional argument for the uuid to
    # `ImageCacheImpl::rasterize_vector_image`, which, if provided, removes any existing parsed svgs associated with the uuid
    # and stores a new entry of uuid -> `PendingImageId` - implements `unbind_from_tree` on SVGSVGElement, which clears the
    # associated images/representations from the image_cache (from `vector_images`, `rasterized_vector_images`, and
    # `completed_loads`) as well as from the layout image resolver image cache.
    # Testing: Each of the following documents should display their (very flashy) content correctly and memory usage should

    # This didn't work until I also evicted the associated image from the layout image resolver image cache and the image
    # cache's `completed_loads` on SVGSVGElement unbind, so it seems like a useful, if a bit redundant, test.
    # ```

    #   document.querySelector("#test"); let r = 10; setInterval(() => {

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42085	(@mrobinson, #42085)	layout: Improve and make consistent the look of various form controls (#42085)
    # This change makes a variety of changes to form controls to improve their appearance.  In general, they now look more
    # similar to Chrome and Firefox:
    # - Padding is added everywhere - Checkboxes and radio buttons are more centered in their containers
    #   and they no longer affect the baseline of their surroundings.
    # - Buttons react when hovered and clicked.  - Form control styles are organized a bit.  - More controls have a style
    # making it obvious they are disabled.
    # There's more work to do here, but it is saved for followup changes - Checkbox checks are not well positioned -- they
    # should likely be an image.  - More work is necessary to ensure that the controls look consistent at all font sizes and
    # that font sizes from the surrounding content do not leak in.
    # Testing: This change causes some WPT tests to start passing some to start failing, due to the fact that we do not
    # properly implement all of the behavior of form controls.
    # Failures:
    #  - `/css/css-flexbox/stretch-flex-item-checkbox-input.html` and
    #   `/css/css-flexbox/stretch-flex-item-checkbox-input.html`: These test the behavior of checkboxes and radio buttons in
    #   flex containers, but since we do not have a Shadow DOM or custom rendering for our controls, we must limit the height
    #   and width of the controls.  Further refinement is necessary here to get this working properly, though it only affects
    #   controls in flex.
    # - `/css/css-grid/subgrid/subgrid-button.html`,
    #   `/css/css-transforms/transform-input-002.html`, `/html/rendering/widgets/button-layout/scrollbars.html`: These two
    #   seem to be minor subpixel variations in the output.
    # - `/html/rendering/widgets/baseline-alignment-and-overflow.tentative.html`:
    #   This tests uspecified behavior about where baselines come from in controls.  We do not implement this yet.
    # - `/pointerevents/pointerevent_lostpointercapture_for_disconnected_shadow_host.html`:
    #   We do not support the `lostpointercapture` event so I suspect this is just timing out in a slightly different way.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41480	(@andreu@andreubotella.com, #41480)	layout: Support `content: <image>` on non-pseudo-elements (#41480)
    # Per CSS-CONTENT-3, one of the possible values of the `content` CSS property is ``, which evaluates to a single ``.  This
    # value is also allowed on regular elements, not just on pseudo-elements, and it will make the element into a replaced
    # element representing the given image, discarding its contents.
    # This patch implements this in `traverse_element`: if the `display` value is not `none` or `contents`, we first check
    # whether the `contents` property should make the element replaced, and if it shouldn't, then we check whether the element
    # itself is replaced or a widget.
    # Per the spec, an invalid image must be treated as representing a transparent black image with zero natural width and
    # height – in particular, it must not show a broken image icon.  We added the method
    # `ReplacedContents::zero_sized_invalid_image` to implement this.
    # This patch adds support for image URL references, but not for color gradients, which are treated as invalid images.  The
    # reason for this is that currently Servo does not support gradients in `ReplacedContentKind`.  This is left as a
    # follow-up change.
    # Testing: Some of the existing `css/css-content/element-replacement*` WPT tests now pass with this patch.  We also added
    # some new ones dealing with replacing the document root.
    # Fixes: #41479
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42038	(@lwarlow@igalia.com, @mrobinson, #42038)	layout: Properly propagate baselines of flex items that do not participate in baseline alignment (#42038)
    # Fix baseline propagation from flex containers
    # Flex item layout previously conflated baselines that got propagated and baseline alignment within flex.
    # Testing: Before and after layout of the manual test cases.

    # [test2.html](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24796679/test2.html) (from Oriol's comment)
    # Fixes: #41905
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42222	(@euclid.ye@huawei.com, #42222)	wpt: Unskip `css-properties-values-api` tests (#42222)
    # This will allow us to see the test improvements from #42136.
    # Testing: Existing WPT
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42220	(@mrobinson, #42220)	layout: Ensure legacy alignment-related presentational hints match specification (#42220)
    # The legacy alignment presentation hints differed from the specification in a way that was breaking them when dealing
    # with ``.  The culprit seems to be the selector `img[type = image i]` which seems a little nonsensical.  This change
    # makes the CSS in `presentational-hints.css` match what is found in the specification.
    # There is still an issue with "bottom" alignment of replaced elements and more investigation is necessary to understand
    # what specified or unspecified behavior we are failing to implement.
    # Testing: This fixes a variety of WPT tests.  Fixes: #41048.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42219	(@eri@igalia.com, #42219)	devtools: Remove unsupported serde annotations from `shared/devtools.rs` (#42219)
    # There were some `#[serde(untagged)]` and `#[serde(skip*)]` annotations in the shared devtools types.  These are needed
    # for correct JSON serialization when sending messages to Firefox, but they fail in multiprocess mode since we are sharing
    # them through the IPC channel with bincode, which doesn't support certain serde tags.
    # The workaround is to keep all shared types free from problematic annotations, and defining wrapping types that are only
    # used in the devtools crate.
    # One instance are console messages and page errors.  They have been moved to `console.rs`, with `shared/devtools` only
    # keeping the parts that are needed for communication between threads.
    # The other instance are auto margins.  Now the final message is built in `page_style.rs`.
    # Apologies since both of them were introduced by me, I wasn't aware that we were limited by bincode in multiprocess mode.
    # A warning has been added to `shared/devtools` listing the problematic annotations that shouldn't be used in this file.
    # Testing: `mach test-devtools` and manual testing using `--multiprocess`.  Fixes: #42170
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42115	(@jschwe, #42115)	Increase stylo stack size in asan and debug builds (#42115)
    # This bumps stylo to allow configuring the stack size of the stylo threads, which fixes crashes with asan and debug
    # builds.
    # Testing: Manual testing with `--with-asan` and with the debug profile.  Fixes: #40814
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42107	(@lwarlow@igalia.com, #42107)	Update details to support `::details-content` pseudo element. (#42107)
    # Update details to support `::details-content` pseudo element.
    # This is currently not element-backed but will support the basic styling.
    # This replaces the existing `::-servo-details-content` styling.
    # Testing: WPTs and manually using https://demo.lukewarlow.dev/css-forms.html

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41956	(@Narfinger, #41956)	painter: Insert a cache for animation with smarter updates (#41956)
    # This inserts a cache in painter that keeps data for animating images in Painter.  We then can send cheap
    # ImageUpdate::UpdateAnimation to just get the required bytes from the cache.
    # There are some warts with the current design: - ImageUpdate::AddImage only adds images in the cache that have the data
    # in SerializableImageData::Raw.  Potentially there could be image animations in other ways which then for a following
    # ImageUpdate::UpdateAnimation we do not have the data.  We can probably fix this on the sender side.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41754	(@stevennovaryo, #41754)	script: Notify `PinchZoom` resizes to `ScriptThread`'s `VisualViewport` (#41754)
    # Continuing the implementation of `VisualViewport`, the resizing of `PinchZoom` should be notified to `ScriptThread` to
    # update the `VisualViewport` interface and to fire the appropriate JS event.  Top level `Window`/`Pipeline` would have a
    # `VisualViewport` interface that mirrors the `PinchZoom` viewport, while nested `Window` would have a default value that
    # represent layout viewport of the relevant iframe.  The `VisualViewport` of an iframe is updated after each reflow that
    # calculate the rectangle of the iframe.
    # The updates of DOM's `VisualViewport` occurs immediately (instead of waiting for the event loop like the viewport) but
    # integrates with the event loop for the JS events.  This behavior would helps with the fact that `VisualViewport` needs
    # to be updated both when it is scrolled or resized.
    # Testing: Existing WPTs and new unit test.  Part of: https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/41341
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41684	(@Narfinger, #41684)	CI/mach: Run wpt tests, smoketest and devtools tests in multiprocess mode (#41684)

    # 017052
    # it would be a good idea to test servo in multiprocess mode as more channels are switched to GenericChannel.  This
    # changes the test-wpt, test-webdriver and smoketest to have a multiprocess argument for most tests.

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42151	(@michael.wu1107@gmail.com, #42151)	script: Ensure web fonts in shadow root stylesheets are downloaded (#42151)
    # Added calls to download web font from stylesheet when stylesheets are added to shadow root.
    # Testing: Manual testing.  Added a new WPT testcase
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42109	(@Taym95, #42109)	wpt: Add a test ensuring non-autoplay audio stays paused after a back navigation (#42109)
    # Testing: New WPT test added.  Fixes: #41281
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41511	(@TimvdLippe, #41511)	wpt: Use Webdriver for all WPT runs (#41511)
    # All other browsers use a single configuration for their browser invocations on WPT.  Servo historically had two: servo
    # and servodriver.  Now that we run WPT on Servo GitHub CI with Webdriver using the servodriver, we can align our
    # configuration with theirs.
    # The existing "servo" configuration is renamed to "servo_legacy" and "servodriver" is then renamed to "servo".  This way,
    # we preserve the "servo" product name as defined on wpt.fyi, but we do use its webdriver configuration.
    # Since webdriver is not fully working yet for debugging purposes, we keep the "servo_legacy" configuration now.  In the
    # future, once the debugging story has improved, we can remove "servo_legacy".
    # All in all, this ensures that both on local, Servo GitHub CI and on wpt.fyi we all use the exact same configuration.  I
    # tested this locally by running the following test:
    # ```
    # ./mach test-wpt tests/wpt/tests/css/css-overflow/scrollbar-gutter-dynamic-004.html
    # ```
    # This does times out with the servo binary and works with the servodriver binary.
    # Running the servo_legacy configuration is done via the `--servo-legacy` flag:
    # ```
    # ./mach test-wpt tests/wpt/mozilla/tests/mozilla/caption.html --servo-legacy
    # ```
    # Fixes #40751
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42243	(@willypuzzle, #42243)	[26488] Refactors GPUCanvasContext to manage context dropping. (#42243)
    # Moves the `Drop` implementation for `GPUCanvasContext` to a new `DroppableGPUCanvasContext` struct.
    # This ensures the context destruction logic is correctly handled, as the `GPUCanvasContext` struct itself is a DOM struct
    # and should not have a drop implementation.  This change aligns with the requirement that DOM types should not implement
    # Drop.
    # Testing: No tests added Fixes: #26488
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42195	(@lwarlow@igalia.com, #42195)	script: Add support for `:open` pseudo-class (#42195)
    # Add support for `:open` pseudo-class.  This is supported on dialog, details and select elements.
    # Stylo PR: servo/stylo#297 Testing: WPTs but also `data:text/html,123:open { background-color: red; }`.  There are some
    # tests that now error, these previously failed due to missing `:open` and now make it further along hitting
    # test_driver.send_keys() which causes them to error Fixes: #41277.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42232	(@euclid.ye@huawei.com, #42232)	mach (Android): Use `CC` instead of forcing `CMake` to build `aws-lc-sys` (#42232)
    # In #41912, the bump of `aws-lc-sys` breaks the Android build, as it replaces CMake build with cc builder for all
    # platforms.  As fallback, we use CMake for Android only.
    # Another bump of it today #42226 is supposed to fix the issue:
    # > Fix building for older Android targets by [@​justsmth](https://github.com/justsmth) in
    # [aws/aws-lc-rs#1013](https://redirect.github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs/pull/1013)
    # , but it [does not](https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/21467527086/job/61832707394).
    # After investigation, we properly set up environment variable to make sure C/C++ compiler bundled with NDK can be used.
    # This makes Android consistent with other platforms.
    # Testing: https://github.com/servo/servo/actions/runs/21468482975/job/61835557765
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42237	(@mrobinson, #42237)	script: Clear layout data on shadow root during `attachShadow` (#42237)
    # When a node has `attachShadow()` successfully called on it, its descendants are no longer in the flat tree.  This change
    # makes it so that the layout data of these descendants is cleared during `attachShadow()` so that the node is no longer
    # considered to have a layout box.
    # Testing: This change includes a new WPT crash test.  Fixes: #42215.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42240	(@mrobinson, #42240)	base: When normalizing `RopeIndex` ensure it does not intersect a character (#42240)
    # When doing operations on `RopeIndex` that need to make slices of lines, this change makes it so that the resulting index
    # does not intersect a character.  This is important because Rust will panic if you attempt to slice a string that way.
    # Testing: This change adds a WPT crash test and a `Rope` unit test.  Fixes: #42217.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42223	(@Narfinger, #42223)	devcontainer: Use copy instead of mount for package list (#42223)
    # Selinux enabled systems have stricter permissions and a bind mount might not work correctly.  Hence, we copy the package
    # list.
    # Signed-off-by: Narfinger
    # Testing: Build the devcontainer on fedora machine.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41178	(@Narfinger, @mrobinson, #41178)	layout: Do not send display lists over a `ipc::bytes_channel()` (#41178)
    # This improves the sending (and receiving) of displaylist.  - In the case that we are not in IPC mode, we essentially
    # replace serialization with a clone of 'DisplayListInfo'.  This the desktop total time spend in the receiving the
    # DisplayList by half and increases the sending slightly.  Perfetto shows for sending 51_354_000 vs 71_476_000 and
    # receiving from 440_455_008 vs 194_509_000).  All numbers are on desktop machines but mobile phones on different tests
    # are similar big improvements.
    # - More surprisingly, in the IPC cases.  we still get a slight improvement in this case too.  We go from the overall
    # handling case from 24_842_000 to 30_989_752 (handle displaylist) but a significant decrease in the send decrease in the
    # sending from 88_199_572 to 23_025_033.  The reason is a bit of a mystery to me.
    # This also makes the code cleaner as we do not have to implement the GenericByteReceiver channel.
    # Testing: It essentially just changes types and how they are serialized.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42233	(@stevennovaryo, #42233)	script: Ensure UA shadow DOM is initialized on `<textarea>` bind to tree (#42233)
    # Ensure that the UA shadow DOM for `` is initialized when we are binding to a tree.
    # Testing: New WPT.  Fixes: #42231
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42185	(@Gae24, #42185)	script: Enable module scripts import attributes (#42185)
    # While working on #42138 I found out that import attributes are an opt-in feature, which can be enabled by
    # `ContextOptionsRef`'s `compileOptions_`.  This is likely the reason why `GetRequestedModuleSpecifier` wouldn't fail.
    # Now we catch any `GetRequestedModuleSpecifier` exception and pass it to `load_state`.
    # Testing: Covered by existing tests
>>> 2026-01-31T06:18:59Z
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42138	(@Gae24, @jdm, #42138)	script: support JSON modules (#42138)
    # With import attributes enabled we can now support non javascript modules, for now we are limited to json ones.  Switch
    # `GlobalScope` `modulemap` to be keyed by the tuple url and module's type.
    # Testing: Enabled a new directory, new tests should pass
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42260	(@webbeef, #42260)	dom: reduce traversal in CompareDocumentPosition (#42260)
    # We can avoid doing 2 traversals and stop at the first matching child we find.  This ensures we are never doing the
    # longest iteration.
    # Testing: covered by WPT
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42238	(@mrobinson, #42238)	constellation: Gracefully handle non-existent `WebView`s in history changes (#42238)
    # Due to timing issues, history changes for closed `WebView`s can be processed in the constellation.  The best way to
    # handle this would be to move these operations to be methods on the `ConstellationWebView`, but that is a larger
    # refactor.  This changes makes it so that the current code handles this situation more gracefully.
    # Testing: It is difficult to test this issue because it requires opening and closing WebViews and is difficult to
    # reproduce.  This is a speculative fix.  Fixes: #41079.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42180	(@sagudev, #42180)	script: Add basic memory pressure reporting to SpiderMonkey (#42180)
    # By reporting memory usage of rust objects back to SM it can trigger GC sooner and release more memory (I hope that we
    # could use this to avoid OOB in webgpu in the future).
    # Currently we use simple `size_of::() + size_of::>()` but it's possible to override reported memory with
    # `update_memory_size(self, nbytes);` on reflector.  This is mostly useful for canvases and buffers which usually have
    # large associated data.
    # Testing: None, but I am wondering if we can connect this to `about:memory`.  Fixes: #42168
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42257	(@Narfinger, #42257)	script: Change some HashSets to FxHashSet (#42257)
    # This changes 3 occurences of HashSet to FxHashSet for speed improvements: - dom/notifications::pending_request_ids:
    # Pending Request ids are Uuid::new_v4, hence, not user assignable.  - script_thread: painters_generating_frames: These
    # are pipeline ids and, hence, ideal for FxHash.  - script_thread:: docs_with_no_blocking_loads: These are Dom and their
    # hash is the ptr address, so ideal for FxHash.
    # Signed-off-by: Narfinger
    # Testing: These do not change functionality.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42184	(@euclid.ye@huawei.com, #42184)	webdriver: Wait indefinitely with `None` timeout (#42184)
    # So far for `None` [timeout](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-timeouts-configuration), we've treated it effectively
    # as no wait which is wrong: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/57332#issuecomment-3804242966.
    # This PR makes all `None` timeouts wait indefinitely.  The funny part is, we somehow have only done it correctly for
    # `pageload`: https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-timeouts-configuration
    # Testing: We add test for script execution with `None` script timeout.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42236	(@Narfinger, #42236)	script/storage: Switch remaining instances of bincode to postcard (#42236)
    # Because of the deprecation of bincode we are switching to postcard (which will already be used by ipc-channel).  This
    # changes all usages to postcard.
    # Sadly there are still some dependencies using bincode, so we are probably increasing the binary size.
    # Currently we do not modify the deny.toml because we have dependencies that depend on bincode.
    # Testing: Compilation should be enough for test.
https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/42249	(@euclid.ye@huawei.com, #42249)	ci: Add 30 mins timeout to bootstrap of bencher, android, ohos, linux UT & WPT (#42249)
    # Also increases timeout from 10 mins to 30mins for linux build job.  Fixes: #42247
