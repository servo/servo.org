In the last week, we merged 39 pull requests.

### Notable additions
 - Keegan [integrated html5ever into Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3702)! Yay! This moves us from using bindings to libhubbub to our own HTML parser written in Rust. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2jgdua/servo_is_now_using_html5ever_for_parsing/) for more details and discussion.
 - Glenn [added `@media` query support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3610). 
 - Patrick rewrote [some of the code for intrinsic widths and table layout](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3609) to match the [in-progress spec](http://dbaron.org/css/intrinsic/)
 - Mukilan [added `setTimeout()`/`setInterval()` support to workers](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3662)
 - Martin [gave individual layers the ability to render their own background](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3672)
 - Patrick [optimized our handling of `font-style`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3697)

This is with Patrick's [work on `linear-gradient`]. Most of the buttons on GitHub now have the correct linear gradient.

 - The November workweek was discussed. The team is probably going to plan out the work for 2015.

 - Some interesting resizing/scrolling changes should be coming soon!
 - Sync script loading is [PR'd](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3721) and landing soon
 - Document load tracking is [PR'd](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3714) and needs a reviewer
