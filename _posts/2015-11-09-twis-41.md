In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-11-02..2015-11-09+user%3Aservo),
we landed 129 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories!

James Graham, a long-time Servo contributor who has been one of the main architects of our testing strategy, now has [reviewer privileges](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/153). No good deed goes unpunished!

### Notable additions

 - Patrick Walton reduced the number of spurious [reflows](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8299) and [compositor events](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8300)
 - Alan Jeffrey got us a huge SpiderMonkey speed boost by [using](https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs/pull/210) `nativeRegExp`
 - Martin Robinson's layerization work has allowed him to [remove](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8334) the incredibly-complicated `layers_needed_for_descendants` handling!
 - Bobby Holley continued his work on fixing performance and correctness of [restyling](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8341)
 - Lars added CCACHE [support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8366) and turned it on for our [SpiderMonkey](https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/62) build, shaving a couple of minutes off the CI builder times
 - Manish made the CI system verify that the [Cargo.lock did not change during the build](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/pull/157), a common source of build woes
 - Matt Brubeck and [others](https://github.com/servo/rust-mozjs/pull/211) have been working on [cleaning](https://github.com/servo/rust-fontconfig/pull/30) [the](https://github.com/servo/cgl-rs/pull/13) [libcpocalypse](https://github.com/servo/io-surface-rs/pull/42)
 - Lars changed how the [Android build](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8288) works, so that now we can have a custom icon, Java code for handling intents, and debug

### Meetings

At last week's [meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-11-02), we discussed review carry-over, test coverage, the 2016 roadmap, rebase/autosquash for the autolander, the overwhelming PR queue, debug logging, and the CSSWG reftests.

There was also an [Oxidation meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Oxidation-2015-11-05), about the support for landing Rust/Servo components in Gecko. Though it mainly covers the needs of larger systems projects, some of the proposed Cargo features (like flat-source-tree) might also be interesting for Servo.
