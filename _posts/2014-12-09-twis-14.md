(I couldn't get to writing a post last week due to Mozlandia)

In the last two weeks, we merged 61 pull requests.

[Matt](https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/cddc6923d4f7130f9fe0faae94f161ba6457d71f) and [Cameron](https://github.com/servo/servo/commit/91be7443df4acd8292fa447aeaac49948188d363) reached a hundred commits each! Congratulations!

We now have switched over from the deprecated [rust-http](https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http) to [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/). Now we can continue improvement of our network stack with the amazing API hyper provides.

The amazing Michael Wu has gotten Servo running on a Flame! You can try it out [here](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4294)

### Meeting(s)

We had a rather productive work week, with many interesting discussions being held. A couple of topics that were discussed with other teams:

 - We plan on getting some Rust code in Gecko (probably a small library). [We had a discussion with the build peers](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-Rust-In-Gecko) on what constraints are on the component to get it integrated with the build system. A couple of things Rust needs:
   - Ability to be debugged on windows
   - (Eventually) distro packaging
   - (Eventually) artifact caching
   - We need to support targeting a [bunch of platforms](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-Rust-In-Gecko#other-platforms), including XP
 - Boot to Servo! We hope to be able to run the Firefox OS home screen in Servo (and beyond). Prerequisites and other issues were discussed in [the meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-B2S).
 - We had a [meeting with the Spidermonkey team](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-JS) where upgrade blockers, threading, sharing a heap/GC were discussed, among other things.
 - We also had discussions with the automation team on [web-platform-tests integration](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-WPT) and [performance/power/mobile testing](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-Automation). Speed, reftests, better tooling, performance testing, device testing, and layout performance were discussed. Hopefully we might have integration with [treeherder](https://treeherder.mozilla.org/) in the future.
 - GFX [was discussed](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlandia-gfx) as well

In this week's meeting ([minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-12-08)), we discussed Rust in Gecko, Spidermonkey/Azure upgrades, dogfooding, and reviews.
