The Servo project has introduced the following sponsorship tiers for people willing to donate money to the project:
- **Platinum: 10,000 USD/month**
- **Gold: 5,000 USD/month**
- **Silver: 1,000 USD/month**
- **Bronze: 100 USD/month**

This is intended for donations with no obligations (i.e no strings attached) from organizations and individuals that would like to get their logo or name at [servo.org homepage]({{ '/#sponsors' | url }}).

Organizations and individuals interested in sponsoring the Servo project through one of these tiers should contact us at <join@servo.org>.

All the information about these new tiers is available at the [Sponsorship page]({{ '/sponsorship/#sponsorship-tiers' | url }}) on this website.

Last, but not least, we're happy to announce our first bronze sponsor [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=servo&utm_medium=sponsor) who has recently started donating to the Servo project. Thank you very much!
