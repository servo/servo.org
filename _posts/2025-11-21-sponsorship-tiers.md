The Servo project has introduced the following sponsorship tiers for people willing to donate money to the project:
- **Platinum: 10,000 USD/month**
- **Gold: 5,000 USD/month**
- **Silver: 1,000 USD/month**
- **Bronze: 100 USD/month**

Organizations and individual sponsors donating in these tiers will be acknowledged on the [servo.org homepage]({{ '/#sponsors' | url }}) with their logo or name. Please note that such donations should come with no obligations to the project i.e they should be "no strings attached" donations. 

Please contact us at <join@servo.org> if you are interested in sponsoring the project through one of these tiers.

All the information about these new tiers is available at the [Sponsorship page]({{ '/sponsorship/#sponsorship-tiers' | url }}) on this website.

Last, but not least, we're happy to announce our first bronze sponsor [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=servo&utm_medium=sponsor) who has recently started donating to the Servo project. Thank you very much!
