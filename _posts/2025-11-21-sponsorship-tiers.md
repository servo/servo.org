The Servo project is happy to announce the following new **sponsorship tiers** to encourage more donations to the project:
- **Platinum: 10,000 USD/month**
- **Gold: 5,000 USD/month**
- **Silver: 1,000 USD/month**
- **Bronze: 100 USD/month**

Organizations and individual sponsors donating in these tiers will be **acknowledged on the [servo.org homepage]({{ '/#sponsors' | url }}) with their logo or name**. Please note that such donations should come with no obligations to the project i.e they should be "no strings attached" donations. All the information about these new tiers is available at the [**Sponsorship** page]({{ '/sponsorship/#sponsorship-tiers' | url }}) on this website.

Please **contact us at <join@servo.org>** if you are interested in sponsoring the project through one of these tiers.

Use of donations is decided transparently via the Technical Steering Committee's public **[funding request process](https://github.com/servo/project/blob/main/FUNDING_REQUEST.md)**, and active proposals are tracked in [servo/project#187](https://github.com/servo/project/issues/187).

Last, but not least, we're excited to **welcome our first bronze sponsor [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=servo&utm_medium=sponsor)** who has recently started donating to the Servo project. Thank you very much!
