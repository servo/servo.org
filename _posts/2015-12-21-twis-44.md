In the [last three weeks](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-11-30..2015-12-21+user%3Aservo), we landed 200 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories.

In a particularly epic display of tenacity, imperio [landed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/8882) a change that he stuck with despite the spec changing out from underneath him while mid-implementation! Nice work, Guillaume.

There were two major Servo-related blog posts in the past weeks. One is by Mike Blumenkrantz (zmike) [covering](http://blogs.s-osg.org/community-driven-wayland-support-servo/) his Wayland port of Servo. The second is by Patrick Walton (pcwalton) [discussing](http://pcwalton.github.io/blog/2015/12/21/drawing-css-box-shadows-in-webrender/) his implementation of CSS Box Shadows in our prototype painting engine, WebRender.

### Meetings

At the [meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-11-30) three weeks ago, we discussed planning topics for Mozlando, the NCSU projects, and crate squatting issues.

Mozlando was a big success! In addition to the [big reveal](https://twitter.com/rustlang/status/674243394240176129) that we're planning to ship at least one Servo component written in Rust in Firefox in 2016, we had a bunch of great meetings. They covered [oxidation](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlando-Oxidation) (Rust in Gecko stuff), [SpiderMonkey](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlando-SM-Servo) integration with Servo, [devtools](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlando-Devtools-Servo) in Servo, [string representations](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlando-Servo-SMStrings), and a deep dive on the proposed [magic DOM](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Mozlando-Servo-MagicDOM) work.

It was a great week!
