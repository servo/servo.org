Please welcome [Alan Jeffrey](https://github.com/asajeffrey), or ajeffrey on IRC, to the Servo team! He will be *doubling* the size
of our "Chicago office." He is currently looking into our performance on [Dromaeo](http://dromaeo.com/), which is
a heavy stress test of our Rust<->JavaScript integration.

In the [last week](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+closed%3A2015-10-12..2015-10-19+user%3Aservo),
we landed 82 PRs in the Servo organization's repositories. Additionally, we passed 5,000 stars on https://github.com/servo/servo!

### Notable additions
