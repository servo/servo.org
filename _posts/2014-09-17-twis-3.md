In the last week, we landed 63 PRs. Servo now uses [Cargo](http://crates.io) and [mach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/mach)!

Cargo unshackles us from makefiles and submodules (mostly), and keeps us running alongside the rest of the Rust community. Additionally, mach makes the build system easy to extend.


### Notable additions
 - Jack [Cargoified servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3230)
 - Clark [added bloom filters for CSS selector matching](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3212). This resulted in a speed improvement of 3.7x for http://cnn.com
 - Patrick added [premultiplying of PNG alphas](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3281)
 - Matt [added support for `background-position`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3296)
 - Glenn improved [support for background images](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3283)
 - Manish [added a lint to help type-check transmutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3258)
 - Jack [fixed loading of file URLs with spaces](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3280)

### Meeting

Stuff discussed in [the meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-09-15):
 
 - Bugs related to testing on the static suite
 - Clark's bloom filter work and performance improvements as a result of it
 - Tables: We're probably going to help work on table spec
 - COW DOM issues and design
 - Rust inheritance: It's time to look at the full set of options proposed as RFCs, taking into consideration what are the biggest pain points of simulating inheritance in Servo today.
