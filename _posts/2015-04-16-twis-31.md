- Josh implemented [child reparenting and node removal](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5781)
- Joe Seaton [extended CSS animation support to most CSS properties](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5704)
- Patrick  tweaked [block size computation for `height:auto` elements with padding](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5641) and [layout of nested elements with different `vertical-align`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5623)
- Ms2ger added [a JS runtime struct](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5632)
- Anthony Ramine [made](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5775) [another](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5721) [set](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5645) [of](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5627) [DOM changes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5617)
- Adenilson implemented [CSS blur filter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5546). Also implemented support for displaying the Firefox [icon for broken image links](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5783) as a follow up to [loading a placeholder](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5366).
