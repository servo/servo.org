### Meeting

Stuff discussed in [the meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-08-25):

 - Travis: Currently, Travis times out or has tasks killed for overusing memory. It's hard to debug this and twe're having a lot more retries than usual. We discussed how to move forward and alternatives to the Travis situation
 - Cargo: We'll be switching to Cargo soon!
 - Libgreen: As Rust is removing native support for green threads. We discussed ways to move forward and where green threads are necessary/useful in Servo
 - Security analysis: We plan on analysing hard data of security bugs in Firefox which Servo can solve (eg use after free)
 - Power measurements: Laleh talks about the latest power measurements and possible causes
