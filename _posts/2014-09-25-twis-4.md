In the last week, we landed 54 PRs. 


### Notable additions
 - Keegan [updated the version of Rust we use](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3438), bringing us to `4d2af38611cdeeb804659b5e0695ad2c251db51a`
 - Chris [implemented TreeWalker](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3253), finishing up [the Traversal parts of the DOM spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#traversal)
 - Cameron [partially](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3433) [removed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3422) instances of the redundant `&JSRef` (`JSRef` itself is a smart pointer)
 - Manish added a [lint](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3374) that guards against usage of unrooted JS-managed values on the stack. This augments the memory safety the type system provides as explained [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2014/08/26/javascript-servos-only-garbage-collector/)
 - Simon [added support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3453) for relative `font-size`
 - Glenn [added support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3449) for `min-width` and `max-width` in images
 - Patrick [fixed](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3399) handling of generated `display:block` content
 - Josh [integrated](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3172) remote Firefox developer tool support.

### Meeting

Stuff discussed in [the meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-09-22):
 
 - Build infra changes: We will be moving back from Travis to bors. (At the time of writing, this change has already happened)
 - HTTP library: [hyper](http://hyperium.github.io/hyper/hyper/index.html) looks promising. A list of our requirements for an HTTP library can be found [here](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/HTTP-library-requirements)
 - Adapting to the removal of libgreen
 - [html5ever](https://github.com/kmcallister/html5ever) is ready for review.
 - Cargo issues were discussed. Cargo no longer hides output from dependencies, which is great!
 - The removal of `&JSRef` was discussed. It would be nice if methods could be defined with `JSRef<self>` (or any other smart pointers).
