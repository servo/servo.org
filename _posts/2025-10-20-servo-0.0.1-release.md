Today Servo has released a version tagged [v0.0.1 - October 2025](https://github.com/servo/servo/releases/tag/v0.0.1), this is basically the same thing we were already providing for the [download page](https://servo.org/download) (note that now we also include arm64 mac binaries), but we are now starting to tag them as releases for future reference.

The plan is to do releases like this on a monthly basis. The release process will use a recent nightly commit to do some additional manual testing in order to check there are no major issues with that version.

So far we don't have plans to publish these releases on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or platform-specific app stores, the idea is to simply make [tagged releases on GitHub](https://github.com/servo/servo/releases).
