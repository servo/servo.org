Today, the Servo team has released new versions of the `servoshell` binaries for all our supported platforms, tagged [v0.0.1](https://github.com/servo/servo/releases/tag/v0.0.1). These binaries are essentially the same nightly builds that were already available from the [download page](https://servo.org/download), but now we have tagged them explicitly as releases for future reference.

We plan to publish such tagged release every month. For now, we are adopting a simple release process where we will use a recent nightly build and perform additional manual testing to identify issues and regressions before tagging and publishing the binaries.

There are currently no plans to publish these releases on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or platform-specific app stores. The goal is just to publish [tagged releases on GitHub](https://github.com/servo/servo/releases).
