In the past three weeks, we merged 141 pull requests.

Samsung OSG published [another blog post](http://blogs.s-osg.org/servo-the-embeddable-browser-engine/) by Lars and Mike. This one focuses on Servo's support for embedding via the CEF API.

The [Rust upgrade of doom](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5935) is finally over. This brings us up to a Rust version from late April. We've now cleared all of the pre-1.0 breaking changes!

Firefox Nightly now has [experimental support for components written in Rust](https://twitter.com/rillian/status/597150813639684096). There's a patch up to [use Servo's URL parser](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1151899), and another team is working on media libraries.

### Notable additions

- WebGL now supports [actually drawing stuff](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5820).
- We merged [basic WebSockets support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5939) thanks to a NCSU student team!
- [WebDriver](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5808) [support](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5962) [continues](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5884) [to](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5969) [improve](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6008) and it's now an option for [running wpt tests](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6022).
- Simon landed [support for `border-collapse`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5870), a significant and painful part of implementing tables fully.
- [There](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5831) [were](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5885) [many](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6014) [fixes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6012) [for](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5911) [layout](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6049) [bugs](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5991)!
- Manish landed [another static check](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5855) for the safety of DOM code, fixing a number of bugs in the process. Several other people contributed DOM cleanups and safety improvements.
- Keegan implemented a [web font sanitizer](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6030) using the same library as Chrome and Firefox.
- Brandon DeRosier landed support for the [HTTP `Accept` header](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5424).
- Thanks to Tim Cuthbertson you can now [submit forms by pressing Enter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5865).
- We improved support for archaic pre-CSS formatting markup, as used on [Hacker News](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5989) and the website for the 1996 film [*Space Jam*](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5851).
- Glenn [improved reftest reliability](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6031) using a better heuristic for when to take a screenshot.
- 2D canvas now [supports rotations](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5945), and canvas animations [no longer pause for layout](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5949).
- We improved [scrolling](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/6011) and [window resizing](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5936) performance.
- Dhananjay Nakrani [contributed `./mach grep`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5842) for speedy searching of the Servo tree.
- We started moving Servo's tests [into the wpt infrastructure](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/5880).

### Screenshots

Having previously conquered
[rectangles](http://blog.servo.org/2015/04/23/twis-31/#screenshots), Servo's
WebGL engine is now capable of drawing a triangle *inside* a rectangle:

### Meetings

We've switched from Critic to [Reviewable](http://reviewable.io/) and it's working pretty well.

Mozillians will be gathering in Whistler, BC next month, and we've started
planning out how the Servo team will participate. We're going to run Rust and
Servo training sessions, as well as meetings with other teams to plan for the
shared future of Gecko and Servo.

Aside from those ongoing topics, here's the breakdown by date of what we've discussed:

[April 27](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-04-27)

- Intermittent test failures on the builders
- We talked about what it would take to use Bugzilla instead of GitHub Issues.
- We discussed what to blog about next; suggestions are welcome!

[May 4](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-05-04)

- The Rust upgrade of doom

[May 11](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-05-11)

- Discussion with Brian Birtles about the emerging Web Animations API
- We're going to start assigning PRs to their reviewers on GitHub.
- Status update on Rust in Gecko. The Gecko teams are doing most of the work :D
- We talked about issues with [the switch to Piston's image library](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/3368).
