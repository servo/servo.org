This week, we merged 37 pull requests.


Servo, Rust, HTML5ever, and Hyper are participating in this year's Google Summer of Code! You can find the project ideas [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:SummerOfCode15#Rust).

### Notable additions

 - Servo landed another [Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4893), bringing us to the Rust version from February 2. We went through around 7 snapshots before reaching this one due to various ICEs and fixes.
 - Nick Nethercote [removed an unnecessary clone of our bloom filter](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4938), reducing the number of clones on a Wikipedia page by 1.2 million. With a five line patch!
 - Manish [upgraded to the latest version of glutin](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4946), pulling in a lot of fixes that were necessary for dogfooding.
 - Bryan Bell [added cursor support for the glutin app](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4896)
 - Glenn added support [for the root element to have percentage heights in layout](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4937)
 - Glenn fixed [background-color calculations for iframes](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4934)
 - Nick Nethercote [fixed memory measurements for jemalloc](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/4917)
