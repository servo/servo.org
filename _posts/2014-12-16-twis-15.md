### Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-12-15)

 - There's a lot of interest in seeing [Firefox.html](https://github.com/paulrouget/firefox.html) work in Servo. We discussed what we need to get that to happen (flexbox, etc)
 - We need to try and eliminate `~/.servo` and `~/.cargo`, build directories should be self contained
 - The gonk port has landed!
 - Rust upgrade, coming soon
