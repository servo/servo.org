### Notable additions

 - Simon landed another [Rust upgrade](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3487)
 - Keegan [removed `servo_util::atom` and switched to string-cache's `Namespace`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3530)
 - Cameron [used Rust's new lifetime bounds feature](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3493) to improve safety checks on `Root` 
 - Glenn [added support for superscripts and subscripts](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3523)

 - Manish [replaced our (mis)use of `Encodable` with `JSTraceable`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3468) by adding a new `#[deriving()]`-like syntax extension
 - Josh and Ms2ger [created a separate smart pointer for nullable JS member pointers](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3531)
 - Lars [disabled Travis](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3473), since we now use bors

### Meeting

Stuff discussed in [the meeting](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-09-29):
 
 - Build infra changes: Bors is doing well, though there are some rough edges that will be fixed.
 - DOM bindings: We need to protect against unwanted moves of `Root`, another lint might help here
 - Josh searches for reviewers for the Spidermonkey upgrade
 - Some of our tests spawn a new Servo process per test. Reusing a process would be better
 - We're coming closer to dogfooding, with [form controls](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3520) coming in and with some work being done on the CSSOM (which fixes jQuery among other things)
 - Security: If we want to dogfod it, we should have some sandboxing and be careful with it. Currently we don't do HTTPS properly (no provision for certificate verification), and don't keep up with SM security patches.
 - Incremental reflow is coming soon!
