Two years after the [renewed activity](https://servo.org/blog/2023/01/16/servo-2023/) on the project we can confirm that Servo is fully back.

If we ignore the bots, in 2024 we've had **129 unique contributors** (+143% over 54 last year), **landing 1,771 pull requests** (+163% over 673), and that's just in [our main repo](https://github.com/servo/servo)!

Including bots, the total number of PRs merged goes up to **2,674** (+144% over 1094). From all this work, 26% of the PRs were made by Igalia, 40% by other contributors and the rest by the bots (34%). This shows how the Servo community has been growing and becoming more diverse with new actors participating actively in the project.

Now let's take a look to the data and chart above, which show the evolution since 2018 in number of merged PRs, unique contributors per year and average contributors per month (excluding bots). We can see **the project is back to numbers of 2018 and 2019 when it was been developed in full speed**!

It's worth noting that Servo popularity keeps growing, with many folks realizing there has been new activity on the project last year, and we have more and more people interested in the project.

During 2024 Servo has been present in **8 events with 9 talks**: [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects/), [Open Source Summit North America](https://youtu.be/RdtlD_7JAs8), [Seattle Rust user meetup](https://servo.org/slides/2024-04-16-seattle-rust-user-group/), [GOSIM Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA_1jxzR85M), [Global Software Technology Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SamA5Oz-G5w), [Linux Foundation Europe Member Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHa4LPpWRh8&t=1351s), [GOSIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpz088cxDcI) [China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c9sHaEXQak), [Ubuntu Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp5n7CSvALA).

If we focus on development there has been many things moving forward during the year. Servo main dependencies (SpiderMonkey, Stylo and WebRender) have been upgraded, the new layout engine has kept evolving adding support for floats, tables, flexbox, fonts, etc. By the end of 2024 [**Servo passes 1,515,229 WPT subtests (79%)**](https://staging.wpt.fyi/results/?sha=58c1148991&label=master&max-count=1&product=servo). Many other new features have been under active development: WebGPU, Shadow DOM, ReadableStream, WebXR, ... Servo now supports two new platforms: Android and OpenHarmony. And we have got the first experiments of applications using Servo as a web engine (like [Tauri](https://servo.org/blog/2024/01/19/embedding-update/), [Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz), [QtWebView](https://github.com/KDABLabs/cxx-qt-servo-webview), [Cuervo](https://github.com/mcclure/cuervo/tree/unstable_traversal_experiment), [Verso](https://github.com/versotile-org/verso/) and [Moto](https://github.com/moto-browser/moto)).

In 2024 we have **raised 33,632.64 USD** with [donations via Open Collective and GitHub Sponsors](/sponsorship/) from **500 different people and organizations**. Thank you all for supporting us!

With this money we have now 3 servers that provides self-hosted runners for Linux, macOS, and Windows reducing our build times **from over an our to under 30 minutes**.

Talking about the future, the Servo TSC has been discussing the [**roadmap for 2025**](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) which has been updated on the Servo's wiki. We have many plans to keep Servo thriving with new features and improvements. Let's hope for a great 2025!
