This week, we landed 25 pull requests.


[This Week In Rust is back!](http://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2014/11/10/this-week-in-rust-56/) If you haven't already, you should check it out!

Last week there were many talks on Servo. Lars gave [a general intro to Servo](https://air.mozilla.org/an-introduction-to-servo/), and there were four talks on Servo during the [Bay Area Rust meetup](https://air.mozilla.org/bay-area-rust-meetup-november-2014/) by Matt, Patrick, Keegan, and Josh.



### Notable additions

 - Ms2ger implemented [`HTMLElement.title`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3901/) and [`HTMLElement.lang`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3914/), and made [another prefix fix](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3905)
 - Patrick [implemented a subset of CSS linear gradients](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3696)
 - Glenn [improved media queries](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3886)
 - Mukilan [made another XHR fix](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3917)
 - Manish [documented the plugins crate and improved compile-time rooting checks](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3903)
 - Bruno [implemented `DOMStringMap`](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3884)
 - Orvar [improved handling of snapshot download failures](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/3894), making the newbie experience less confusing

### Statistics

You can find some cool commit stats [here](http://www.joshmatthews.net/servo-stats.html).

We also have some stats on CSS property usage [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CxLS8w8GwK-2euVErrqpUUb76PiZa6w5h5EnGsL9KFs/edit?usp=sharing). More details and caveats on the same can be found [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.servo/iB8fZ7SUS0Q)

### Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2014-11-10)

We assigned action items from the previous work week, and discussed the next one a bit. 

Additionally, we discussed having an autogenerated version of [Patrick's CSS stats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CxLS8w8GwK-2euVErrqpUUb76PiZa6w5h5EnGsL9KFs/edit?usp=sharing) to be generated with each PR, and how to handle codegen for supported/unsupported styles post-CSSOM.
