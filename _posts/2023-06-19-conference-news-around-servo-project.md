In May 2023, Martin Robinson from the Servo project team had the chance to participate in [**RustNL 2023**](https://2023.rustnl.org/) conference in Amsterdam. There he gave a [lighting talk about Servo project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHvHoAO5oo) and the current plans. In addition, he participated in some follow up discussions about Servo and how some UI frameworks in the Rust ecosystem are exploring the possibility to use it.

In the first week of June 2023, Servo project team participated in the [**Web Engines Hackfest 2023**](https://webengineshackfest.org/2023/). There, Delan Azabani gave a [talk about Servo project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfk8s5OD99A), getting into details of the work performed in the first semester and the plans for the rest of the year; the talk provided some valuable insights on running [demos](https://demo.servo.org/) on Servo, including updates on the status of floats and the transition of Servo's layout. Also, there were some engaging discussions around the future of the Stylo crate in Gecko and Servo.

Apart from that in the same event there was a [breakout session about Servo](https://github.com/Igalia/webengineshackfest/issues/16) where various topics were addressed, such as webrender, style crate, and the synchronization process for both their current and future developments. Of particular interest was the implementation of the Embedding API and the associated challenges. Lastly, there was a discussion on simplifying the contribution process to the Servo project, with a focus on making it more beginner-friendly, enabling a broader participation from interested individuals. You can check the [session notes online](https://github.com/Igalia/webengineshackfest/wiki/2023-Servo).

End of the June, Servo is going to be present at [**Embedded Open Source Summit**](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/embedded-open-source-summit/) in Prague. If you are participating in such event, feel free to [approach us](mailto:info@servo.org) and ask any question about the project status and future plans.
