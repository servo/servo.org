Servo has had some exciting changes land in our nightly builds over the last month:

* as of 2023-09-23, **‘@media (resolution)’** queries are now supported ([@sagudev](https://github.com/sagudev), [#30406](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30406))
* as of 2023-09-28, the **‘dir’ attribute getter** now behaves correctly ([@EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL), [#30435](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30435))
    * this fixes **over 12000 subtests** in the HTML test suite!

        display: none;

    ._fig:not(#specificity) {
        width: 33em;
        max-width: 100%;
        margin: 1em auto;
    }
    ._fig > ._flex {
        display: flex;
    }
    ._runin {
        margin-bottom: 1em;
    }
    ._runin > p,
    ._runin > h2 {
        display: inline;
    }
</style>

Much of the recent work on Servo has been around upgrading the components we share with Firefox:

* **SpiderMonkey** — upgraded from 107 to 115 ([@sagudev](https://github.com/sagudev), [mozjs#408](https://github.com/servo/mozjs/pull/408), [#30379](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30379))
* **Stylo** — upgrade continues, with another 65 commits now landed in Servo ([@Loirooriol](https://github.com/Loirooriol), [#30421](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30421))
* **WebRender** — upgraded to [May 2021]([#30323](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30323)), now fixing regressions and preparing for more breaking changes:
    * <span class=_none>as of 2023-09-19,</span> we’ve fixed a scrolling regression in **Acid2** and other quirks mode pages ([@mrobinson](https://github.com/mrobinson), [#30375](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30375))
    * <span class=_none>as of 2023-09-21,</span> we’ve fixed a major **WebGL** regression related to tile cache invalidation ([@mukilan](https://github.com/mukilan), [#30390](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30390))
    * <span class=_none>as of 2023-10-04,</span> pinch zoom is now handled in Servo, preparing us for its removal from WebRender ([@mrobinson](https://github.com/mrobinson), [#30446](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30446), [#30459](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30459))

Sometimes the best source of ideas for improving Servo is to focus on a real-world app.
[Ennui @EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL) is doing exactly that with [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), a 2013 idle game that relies on CSS positioning, transitions, transforms, filters, and 2D canvases.

* as of 2023-10-05, the **CSS ‘drop-shadow()‘ filter** is now supported ([@EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL), [#30439](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30439))
* as of 2023-10-10, CSS filters are now correctly **clipped by ‘overflow: hidden’** ([@EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL), [#30517](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30517))
* as of 2023-10-19, **drawImage()** on a 2D canvas now uses shared memory for performance ([@EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL), [#30544](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/30544))
* her work continues in [#30535](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/30535), with an analysis of Servo’s performance issues under Cookie Clicker
