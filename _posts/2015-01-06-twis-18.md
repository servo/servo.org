### Meeting

[Minutes](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Meeting-2015-01-05)

 - Accessibility: Probably not just yet, but we plan to do something similar to what e10s is doing.
 - Cookies: We have a pull request up, needs review. Also we have hardcoded Japanese poems in the source code, apparently.
 - Rust upgrade: Almost done! We'll probably do another rust upgrade once the alpha comes out.
