# Sponsorship

You can support the development of Servo project in different ways.

By donating via [**GitHub Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/servo) or the [**Servo Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/servo), you can support the project's infrastructure and hosting costs. The money there is used to keep the project up and running, including CI bots and related hardware requirements for the project.
