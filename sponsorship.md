# Sponsorship

You can now help fund the Servo project by [sponsoring us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/servo) or [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/servo).

<aside class="_note">

Note that we will stop accepting donations [on LFX](https://crowdfunding.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/projects/servo) soon.
Any funds left over will also be transferred to the Servo project, but recurring donations will be cancelled, so if you would like to continue your recurring donation, please do so on GitHub or Open Collective.
</aside>

Both one-time and monthly donations are appreciated, and over 80% of the amount will go directly towards improving Servo.
The way the funds are used is decided in public via the Technical Steering Committee, but to give you a sense of scale…

- at **100 USD/month**, we can cover the costs of our website and other core infrastructure
- at **1,000 USD/month**, we can set up dedicated servers for faster Windows and macOS builds, better test coverage and reliability, and new techniques like fuzzing and performance testing
- at **10,000 USD/month**, we can sponsor a developer to make Servo their top priority

## Servo Project Fund

The purpose of the Servo Project Fund is to raise, budget, and spend funds in support of the Servo Project.

The Fund is governed by the Directed Fund’s Governing Board at the Linux Foundation Europe. The Board is composed of Members, together with representation from the Linux Foundation Europe and the Technical Steering Committee.

There are currently no members of the Linux Foundation Europe Directed Fund’s Governing Board.

If your organization is interested in becoming a member, please contact us at <join@servo.org> or enroll at the [Linux Foundation member enrollment page](https://enrollment.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/?project=servo).

## Donation fees

The fees for donations on Open Collective depend on how much you donate in a single transaction, and what payment method you use:

- Donating at least **5 USD** at a time ensures that **over 80%** goes to Servo
- Donating at least **50 USD** at a time ensures that **over 90%** goes to Servo
- Donating with Stripe is almost always better for Servo than donating with PayPal

<figure class="_donation_fees">

| Fees for... | 5 USD | 10 USD | 20 USD | 50 USD | 100 USD | 1000 USD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Stripe (card, USA) |
| Stripe (card, international) |
| Stripe (card, worst case) |
| PayPal (USA) |

The exact fees for donations on GitHub Sponsors are still being worked out with GitHub, but we’ll post them here once we know.
