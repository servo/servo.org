        Note: A few web platform features required by modern web pages are not enabled
        by default. These can be enabled using the "Enable experimental web
        platform features" button in the toolbar (shown below) or, when launching from
        the command line, by passing the <code>--enable-experimental-web-platform-features</code>
        flag to the servo binary.
