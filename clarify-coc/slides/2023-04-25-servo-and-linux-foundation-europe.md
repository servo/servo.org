> Industry support for this move is coming from Futurewei, Let’s Encrypt, Mozilla, Samsung, and Three.js, among others.

> “We’re excited to support and sustain this important work for decades to come.”

[Press release (17 Nov 2020)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/press-release/open-source-web-engine-servo-to-be-hosted-at-linux-foundation)

</div>

* Due to changes in strategies/priorities this industry support did not happen.

-----

## Linux Foundation Europe

* Brussels (Belgium) based non-profit, established in September 2022.
* LF US is the parent company which owns LF Europe.
* Goal: Intra- and inter-regional open source and open standard collaboration in Europe, with both public and private sectors as well as individual contributors.

Note:

* LF US members can become LF Europe members without paying extra money.

----

### LF Europe projects

* [OpenWallet Foundation](https://openwallet.foundation/)
* [Sylva](https://gitlab.com/sylva-projects/sylva)

Note:

* OpenWallet Foundation: A consortium of companies and non-profit organisations collaborating to drive global adoption of open, secure and interoperable digital wallet solutions.
* Sylva: A telco-related project aiming to release a cloud software framework that would follow EU regulations with respect to security.

## Move Servo to LF Europe?

----

### Better visibility and increased marketing

* LF Europe currently has only two projects, and Servo will be the third.
* We expect that LF Europe will be able to dedicate more time and resources towards Servo.

----

### Funding potential

* Servo has been with LF US since 2020, but hasn't been able to attract new funding.
* We hope this could improve with LF Europe creating opportunities for new sponsors to join.
* We also have plans to look for funding in Europe (including European Union grants) and other regions.

Note:

* Only one company supporting Servo through the LF board.

----

### Market access

* There's a large embedded device industry in Europe, with many users that could benefit from a project like Servo.
* Some of these companies are members or LF Europe and might be willing to sponsor projects under that umbrella.

----

### Independence

* Main web rendering engines are controlled by US corporations (Apple, Google, and Mozilla).
* Having an independent non-US web engine might help to attract more companies from the rest of the world.

----

### Implications

* No actual changes to the project itself, other than a new charter that would need to be approved by the Servo TSC.
* We can revert this decision and move back to LF US in the future if needed.
