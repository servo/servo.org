+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39546	(@simonwuelker, #39546)	Move XPath implementation into its own crate (#39546)
    ;crate; xpath implementation with a bring-your-own-dom API
    # XPath (and, in the future, XSLT) is only loosely coupled to `script`.  As `script` is already very large, I'd like to
    # move the xpath parser and evaluator into a seperate crate.  Doing so allows us to iterate on it more easily, without
    # having to recompile `script`.  Abstracting over the concrete DOM implementation could also allow us to write some more
    # comprehensive unit tests.
    # Testing: Covered by existing web platform tests Part of https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/34527 Fixes
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/39551
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39501	(@mrobinson, #39501)	servoshell: Do not override HiDPI ratio when taking screenshots (#39501)
    servoshell; screenshots use current DPI of system
    # This override is meant to force reftests to always run with a device pixel ratio of 1.0.  Reftests are always run in
    # headless mode which uses a device pixel ratio of 1.0 regardless (unless you override it).  Removing this particular
    # override allows taking screenshots in the system DPI when taking them in headed mode, which is actually a bit useful.
    # Testing: A test verifying the old behavior is removed.  This causes `/css/pixel_snapping_position_a.html` to start
    # passing.
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39586	(@mrobinson, #39586)	libservo: Re-export types that are used by servoshell (#39586)
    # servoshell should not depend on internal Servo crates.  Instead, `libervo` should re-export any types that are used by
    # embedders.  This change does that re-export for private types currently used by servoshell.
    # Testing: This just changes the way types are imported, so curent tests should suffice.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39506	(@tharkum, #39506)	html: Allow legacy referrer policies only for <meta> referrer (#39506)
    dom
    # Follow the HTML specification and allow to use legacy referrer policies (never/default/always/origin-when-crossorigin)
    # only with 'meta' referrer.
    # See https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#meta-referrer (step 5)
    # While for another HTML elements with 'referrerpolicy' content attribute
    # (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#referrer-policy-attribute) and for 'Referrer-Policy' HTTP header
    # (https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/#referrer-policy-header-dfn) the referrer policy should be determine
    # from the standard policy tokens (https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/#referrer-policy).
    # So unknown policy values (legacy from meta-referrer) will be ignored and determine as 'ReferrerPolicy::EmptyString'.
    # Testing: No changes
    # Fixes: #36833
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36322	(@Loirooriol, #36322)	layout: Let min/max constraints avoid collapsing bottom margins (#36322)
    layout
    # When `block-size` was intrinsic and there was no block-end padding or margin, we were allowing the block-end margin of
    # the box to collapse with the block-end margin of its contents.
    # However, due to `min-block-size` or `max-block-size`, the final size can be different than the intrinsic size of the
    # contents.  In that case it didn't make any sense to collapse end margins, only WebKit does it too.
    # This patch takes the final size into account, like Gecko and Blink.  This is under discussion in
    # https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12218, but for now we will match Blink.
    # Testing: 2 tests are now passing.  There is also 1 new failure, but that test only passes in WebKit and I don't agree
    # with it.
    # Fixes: #36321
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39589	(@mrobinson, #39589)	script: Use `conditional_malloc_size_of` for `Rc` types on `Window` (#39589)
    # This allows measuring the size of these types conditionally rather than ignoring them.
    # Testing: This modifies which things are measured by `MallocSizeOf` which isn't covered by tests.
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39588	(@simonwuelker, #39588)	script: Remove unreachable assertions in xpath parser (#39588)
    # `relative_path_expr` can only ever return `Expr::Path`.  If we make it return a `PathExpr` then callers can rely on this
    # invariant.
    # Testing: There's only limited testing for this change due to https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/39551.  But I think
    # that's okay, since the change is fairly trivial.  Part of https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/34527
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39583	(@mrobinson, @delan, #39583)	libservo: Add a `WebView::take_screenshot()` API and use it for reftests (#39583)
    ;embedding
    # This change adds a new API to the `WebView` for capturing screenshots.  This makes it possible to:
    #  - use the reftest waiting infrastructure via the API
    #    easily.
    #  - take more than a single screenshot in one Servo run.  - take screenshots, but still paint the `WebView` normally
    #  prior
    #    to the moment that the screenshot is ready, instead of preventing all non-screenshot-ready paints while taking a
    #    screenshot.
    # In addition, the previous infrastructure, the `wait_for_stable_image` option is removed completely.
    # Testing: This change is tested by the passing of the WPT tests, as they commonly use the screenshot feature.
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39502	(@shubhamg13, #39502)	compositor: Add Paint Metric events to Perfetto Traces (#39502)
    # > Some metrics like TimeToFirstPaint and TimeToFirstContentfulPaint are only in the HTML traces.  [See
    # this](https://github.com/servo/perf-analysis-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-analyse-a-single-servo-sample)
    # In order to analyse the performance and refine [perf-analysis-tools](https://github.com/servo/perf-analysis-tools) we
    # need these metrics to be added to Perfetto also.
    # Testing: Verified by using Perfetto traces
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39571	(@Loirooriol, #39571)	layout: Avoid negative corner radii values for border-radius (#39571)
    layout
    # The `border-radius` property provides the radii for the border box.  For the curvature of the padding and content boxes,
    # we then subtract the border and padding sizes.  However, we weren't flooring the result by zero, which could make the
    # background completely disappear when using `background-clip: padding-box` or `background-clip: content-box`.
    # Testing: Adding 4 new tests, but 2 of them fail in both Servo and Firefox.  Fixes: #39540
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39585	(@Gae24, #39585)	script: move testbinding DOM interfaces to script/dom/test (#39585)
    # Move testbinding interfaces to it's own module, to avoid cluttering dom folder.
    # Testing: A successful build is enough Part of #38901
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39568	(@mrobinson, #39568)	layout: Ensure that the `Epoch` stored in layout is accurate (#39568)
    # The first epoch is 0 as that is the one used in the initial transaction, but the code was setting the first `Epoch` to
    # `Epoch(1)`.  This means that when layout advanced the epoch, the `Epoch` of the first produced display list was
    # `Epoch(2)`.
    # This change makes the value reflected in `current_epoch` actually match the index of the display list produced.  In
    # addition, we always store this epoch in `PipelineDetails` in the renderer.  This will be important when adding the
    # `WebView::take_screenshot` API.
    # Testing: This should not change behavior, so is covered by existing tests which rely on proper `Epoch` advancement.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39544	(@RichardTjokroutomo, @jdm, @yezhizhen, #39544)	script: Add line number argument to module script compilation functions (#39544)
    dom
    # Script: added ```line_no``` as argument to both ```fetch_inline_module_script()``` & ```compile_module_script()``` to
    # fix the inline script reporting wrong line issue ([#39415](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/39415)).
    # Originally, the function ```compile_module_script()``` hardwires the value 1 when invoking
    # ```CompileOptionsWrapper::new()```.  This is fine if the script is written in separate JS file, but for inline scripts,
    # it will cause confusion if the `````` tag doesn't start from line #1.
    # ```line_no``` is obtained from ```line_number```, a member variable from ```HTMLScriptElement```.
    # Credits to @jdm for actually pointing out which functions to fix.
    # Testing: Created a WPT test for this change, specifically:
    # ```tests/wpt/tests/html/semantics/scripting-1/the-script-element/module/evaluation-error-5.html```.
    # Fixes: issue [#39415](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/39415)

    ;dom
    # Support `keyCode` and `charCode` fields in KeyboardEventInit for Speedometer 3.0
    # Speedometer 3.0 fails because Servo's KeyboardEvent constructor ignores keyCode and charCode parameters, hardcoding them
    # to 0.  This breaks frameworks that check `event.keyCode === 13` for Enter key detection.  This is how [Speedometer 3.0
    # dispatches key
    # events](https://github.com/WebKit/Speedometer/blob/8d67f28d0281ac4330f283495b7f48286654ad7d/resources/benchmark-runner.m

    # 0).
    # Speedometer 3.0 uses the modern KeyboardEvent constructor but passes [legacy fields like keyCode and
    # charCode](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#legacy-dictionary-KeyboardEventInit) in the init dictionary for backwards
    # compatibility with older frameworks(for example: backbone.js)
    # This change uncomments the legacy KeyboardEventInit fields and updates the constructor to read them from the init
    # dictionary instead of hardcoding to 0.

    # we use the WebDriver Take Screenshot action, which currently takes the screenshot immediately.  we think this might be a
    # source of regressions.
    # this patch makes the WebDriver actions Take Screenshot and Take Element Screenshot use the same new
    # WebView::take_screenshot() API as servoshell’s --output option, such that those actions now wait for [a variety of

    # - we remove the retry loop where we try to take a screenshot every second for up to 30 seconds - we send the result as a
    # image::RgbaImage over crossbeam without shared memory (it’s not cross-process) - we now handle the zero-sized element

    # to repeat this work for every single SVG on a page; we can do it once when creating an image cache in a process and
    # reuse that font information for all derived image caches in the same process.
    # Testing: Manually verified that pages with SVGs still load.  There should be no observable behaviour change in WPT
    # tests.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39607	(@mrobinson, #39607)	script: Do not show simple dialogs for Windows that cannot show them and normalize newlines (#39607)
    dom
    # The specification has a list of rules about when [simple dialogs cannot be shown][u1].  This change implements that part
    # of the specification and also the bits that specify when to noramlize newlines in their messages.  In addition, it fills
    # in the remaining specification step comments for these methods.
    # [u1]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#cannot-show-simple-dialogs
    # Testing: This causes some CSP tests run via servodriver to start passing.  Unexpected alert dialogs cause failures in
    # servodriver.

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39660	(@TimvdLippe, #39660)	Define conditional_malloc_size_of for all Rc (#39660)
    # This updates all Rc that were ignored for malloc_size_of to use conditional_malloc_size_of, unless the type in the Rc
    # itself doesn't support malloc_size.
    # Regular expressions used to search for all occurrences:
    # ``` ignore_malloc_size_of = "Rc.*" ignore_malloc_size_of = "Arc.*" ```
    # There are a couple left since they have nested Rc, which I don't know how to fix.
    # To be able to define these, several new implementations were added to `malloc_size_of/lib.rs` as well as
    # `HashMapTracedValues`.
    # Testing: if it compiles, it's safe
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39656	(@mrobinson, #39656)	wpt: Capture test output when running WPT in WebDriver mode (#39656)
    # We were capturing test output (such as stack traces) by using the "test" key in the data provided to the
    # `process_output` log handler.  This doesn't work for WebDriver mode because the test runner runs in another process
    # entirely and it may reuse Servo executable instances for tests.
    # This change maps browser process output to tests using the "browser_pid" key that is often provided while in WebDriver
    # mode.
    # Testing: This modifies the test harness, so the tests are running tests.  Fixes: #39176

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39690	(@Loirooriol, #39690)	layout: Remove some unneeded type annotations (#39690)
    # Testing: unneeded, no behavior change
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39689	(@Loirooriol, #39689)	Test that text with `font-size: 0` has an intrinsic contribution of 0 (#39689)
    # The problem reported in #29675 was (accidentally?) fixed by #32278.  Let's add a test.
    # Testing: Adds a new WPT.  Fixes: #29675
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39688	(@Loirooriol, #39688)	layout: Unify line height resolution (#39688)
    # Both `flow/inline/line.rs` and `flow/inline/mod.rs` had a function to resolve the `line-height` value.  They were pretty
    # much the same, except that the former wasn't handling single-line text inputs.  But I don't think it matters, since the
    # text inside such input can't be styled with `vertical-align: top` or `bottom`.
    # Thus this patch unifies the logic.  And to simplify the callers, now this function accepts a
    # `&InlineContainerStateFlags` instead of a bool for identifying single-line text inputs.
    # Testing: There shouldn't be any behavior change.  This is part of #39664
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39610	(@mrobinson, @Loirooriol, #39610)	script: Use CSP sandboxing flags for `<iframe>` and pass them to child `Document`s (#39610)
    dom
    # This change makes it so that `` sanboxing is equivalent to the one used for Content Security Policy, which is how the
    # specification is written.  In addition, these sandboxing flags are passed through to `` `Document`s via `LoadData` and
    # stored as `Document::creation_sandboxing_flag_set`.  The flags are used to calculate the final
    # `Document::active_sandboxing_flag_set` when loading a `Document`.
    # This change makes it so that ``s actually behave in a sandboxed way, the same way that `Document`s with CSP
    # configurations do.  For instance, now scripts and popups are blocked by default in ``s with the `sandbox` attribute.
    # Testing: This causes many WPT tests to start to pass or to move from ERROR to TIMEOUT or failing later.  Some tests
    # start to fail:
    #  - `/html/semantics/embedded-content/the-canvas-element/canvas-descendants-focusability-005.html`: This test uses a
    #  combination of `` and Canvas fallback content, which we do not support.  -
    #  `/html/semantics/embedded-content/the-iframe-element/iframe_sandbox_navigate_other_frame_popup.sub.html`: This test is
    #  now failing because the iframe is sanboxed but in the ScriptThread now due to `allow-same-origin`.  More implementation
    #  is needed to add support for the "one permitted sandbox navigator concept."
    # Fixes: This is part of #31973.
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39645	(@gterzian, #39645)	script: implement url matches about:blank (#39645)
    # Implement [matches-about:blank](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#matches-about:blank), and uses it to compute the
    # fallback url of a document.
    # This will also be useful as part of [fixing iframe loading](https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/31973).
    # There is one unrelated change to origin.rs, which is the result of an fmt.
    # Testing: added unit-tests and the fallback url should be covered by wpt tests.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39682	(@mrobinson, @delan, @yezhizhen, #39682)	webdriver: Apply script timeout to related IPC messaging as well (#39682)
    webdriver
    # In some cases scripts never call their `setTimeout` guard.  In that case also timeout if we never hear a reply from the
    # script thread.  In general, the script timeout is applied to all synchronous IPC waiting for script replies.
    # In addition, rework timeout setting a bit to be more similar to the specifciation.
    # Testing: This causes some tests run with the WebDriver test runner to fail with TIMEOUT rather than CRASH, accurately
    # reflecting their reason for failing.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39620	(@yezhizhen, @mrobinson, #39620)	webdriver: Implement implicit wait for "Element retrieval" (#39620)
    webdriver
    # Implicit wait is specified in [WebDriver spec](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-find), which is used to keep
    # retrieving elements until found or timeout.  This is really convenient for automation with real websites.
    # Testing: Manually tested with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/waits/#implicit-waits).
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39684	(@mrobinson, @delan, #39684)	compositor: Fix a performance regression from #39583 (#39684)
    perf
    # When processing new WebRender frames after handling messages in the compositor, only do that when we actually receive
    # `NewWebRenderFrameReady` messages.  This isn't an issue unless there are active animations.  When there are, every spin
    # of the event loop was triggering a repaint.
    # Testing: This should fix the performance regression on the Speedometer Bencher benchmarks.  Fixes: #39641
-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39683	(@Narfinger, #39683)	OHOS/Android: Fix black screen of app. (#39683)

    ;embedding
    # The embedder should never be responsible for triggering click events, so this change removes that possibility from the
    # API.  In addition, triggering of click events is simplified by moving the logic to the `DocumentEventHandler`.  This has
    # the benefit of making behavior consistent between in-process and out-of-process ``s.  Now click events are never
    # triggered when the button up and down cross frame boundaries.

    layout
    # The previous implementation in #39519 mistakenly used the `FontTemplateDescriptor` to determine whether the font face

    # initialized in the "uncustomized" state.  Although our rust implemention also initializes the elements in "uncustomized"
    # state, this particular call to `set_custom_element_state` can't simply be removed as this call also ensures that the
    # element's DEFINED state is set to 'true', to match the `:defined` selector, based on the custom element state.
    # So, introduce a new method that will only set the `ElementState::DEFINED` flag by manipulating the state directly and
    # call it from `Element::create` when creating uncustomized, built-ins.

    # move the submodules, but they are copied without removal in this patch.  It is because they are used by the `wrapKey`
    # and `unwrapKey` operations which have not migrated at this moment.  Once `wrapKey` and `unwrapKey` are migrated, they

    ;api; WebViewDelegate::notify_keyboard_event() is now notify_input_event_handled(); now covers all input events; now includes information about whether the event was consumed and/or had preventDefault
    # Servo currently has three ways of notifying the embedder that input events have been processed.
    # 1.  `WebViewDelegate::notify_keyboard_event`: This is used to implement
    #    overridable keybindings in servoshell.  It notifies the embedder when a keyboard event has been processed, but not
    #    "handled" by the engine.
    # 2.  WebDriver's command message senders and receivers, this is used to
    #    let WebDriver wait until events have been handled to continue with script execution.
    # 3.  Touch event processing notifications: This is used to serialize touch
    #    event processing.
    # This change unifies the first two things with a new `WebViewDelegate::notify_input_event_handled` API.  This API informs
    # the embedder (via a generated id) that an input event has finished processing and what the result of the processing was.
    # This allows embedders to do other things with events once they have been processed.  For example, embedders might want
    # to chain unconsumed events up to parent widgets or to add support for overridable keybindings.
    # As part of this the `canceled` flag in script's `Event` data structure is turned into a `bitflags` mirror of the new API
    # type to describe the result of event handling.
    # Testing: This shouldn't change observable behavior and is thus covered by existing tests.  The new API is consumed by
    # servoshell, which uses it for tests.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39814	(@kkoyung, #39814)	script: Change type of [[algorithm]] internal slot of CryptoKey (#39814)
    webcrypto
    # CryptoKey interface has an internal slot named [[algorithm]], which store a WebIDL dictionary [1].  CryptoKey also
    # stores a cached ECMAScript Object associated with the [[algorithm]] internal slot, and returns this object when the
    # interface member `algorithm` is called [2].
    # In our current implementation, when we create a new `CryptoKey`, we need to manually construct an ECMAScript Object for
    # the [[algorithm]] internal slot, and provide it to `CryptoKey::new`.  Then, the provided object directly is stored in
    # `CryptoKey`.
    # There are several issues with this design.
    # - `CryptoKey::new` accepts arbitrary ECMAScript Object via a `HandleObject` value.  It basically relies on the caller to
    # provide a correct object.  - When we want to access the dictionary members of the [[algorithm]] internal slot, we need
    # to first convert the ECMAScript Object back to a WebIDL dictionary.  Although we have a separate field in the
    # `CryptoKey` struct to store the `name` member of the dictionary for convenience, it is still not easy to access other
    # members.
    # This patch makes the following change: Instead of storing an ECMAScript Object provided by the caller and a separate
    # name for convenience, we store (our "subtle" struct of) WebIDL dictionary type in Rust, generated by codegen, in the
    # [[algorithm]] internal slot.  Moreover, the cached ECMAScript Object associated with the [[algorithm]] internal slot is
    # constructed from the [[algorithm]] internal slot internally, and we store it in the [[algorithm_cached]] internal slot.
    # The benefits of this new design are:
    # - The caller can directly provide the WebIDL dictionary in Rust to `CryptoKey`, without manually creating an ECMAScript
    # Object.  - When we want to access the [[algorithm]] internal slot, we don't need to do a ECMAScript-Object-to-dictionary
    # conversion.  - The Rust type system with an implementation of the `SafeToJSValConversion` trait can guarantee the cached
    # ECMAScript Object associated with the [[algorithm]] internal slot is in good shape.

    input; more reliable notification of input events in some edge cases
    # The `WebViewDelegate::notify_input_event_handled` method is called for the embedder when an input event's processing has
    # finished within Servo.  This allows the embedder to chain the event up to parent widgets or do some kind of
    # post-processing such as the implementation of overridable keybindings.
    # This change makes it so that this method is called even when an input event cannot successfully be sent to a pipeline.
    # This could happen when an event is handled during navigation or perhaps during shutdown.  In any case, Servo should
    # *always* tell the embedder when the event is done processing so that they don't get eaten by the Servo widget.
    # Testing: This is very difficult to test as it only happens in very specific time-sensitive sitautions.
+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39800	(@simonwuelker, #39800)	XPath: Flatten the AST to make it more flexible (#39800)
    perf; preparation for optimising xpath queries
    # The current XPath AST is tightly tied to the parser grammar.  To address issues like
    # https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/39739, we'll want to do optimization passes on the AST in the future, which
    # requires relaxing it's structure first.
    # This PR moves the AST structure into a separate module and flattens it into a shape where most expressions are variants
    # of the core `Expression` enum.
    # This also has the nice side effect of being a net reduction in LoC and making the AST *significantly* easier to read.
    # I think the difference between the old and new structure is best explained by example.  One of our unit tests parses
    # `concat('hello', ' ', 'world')`, and the current AST looks like this:
    # ```rust Expr::Path(PathExpr {
    #     is_absolute: false, is_descendant: false, steps: vec![StepExpr::Filter(FilterExpr {
    # 	primary: PrimaryExpr::Function(CoreFunction::Concat(vec![

    # 	    }),
    # 	])), predicates: PredicateListExpr { predicates: vec![] },
    #     })],
    # }), ``` After this change, the AST looks like this: ```rust Expression::Function(CoreFunction::Concat(vec![

    # The height of an inline box is typically decided by font metrics, but if it's on a phantom line box, then it should be
    # zero.
    # This is hard to observe, because the contents of a phantom line box are typically invisible, but it's noticeable on
    # these cases:
    #  - If the inline has a box shadow or an outline (not on all browsers).  - If the inline establishes a containing block

    # Nextest is a powerful test runner, with many advantages over cargo test.  Among others it will run each test in a
    # separate process, provide a summary of the completed test execution, supports output formats like JUnit, and can handle
    # flaky test by retrying.  This PR does not use most of these advanced features yet though, that will be left to future
    # PRs.
    # The change also uncovered racy tests in `net` which rely on someone initializing the `ASYNC_RUNTIME` before the test in
    # questions is run.  By explicitly accessing the lazy static in a common setup routine, we make sure it is initialized.
    # CLI differences of `cargo test` vs `cargo nextest`:
    # - The `--profile` option in nextest is not the cargo profile, but refers to nextest configuration profiles.  -
    # `--nocapture` is a direct argument to nextest, not to the testharness, so we can remove the preceding `--` seperator.

    ;api; breaking change
    # This change is meant to make it more obvious that adjusting the pinch zoom of a `WebView` works differently than
    # adjusting the page zoom.  New pinch zoom values are *always* zoom deltas, that is they are always multiplied by the
    # current pinch zoom value.  This is due to the way that system APIs and Servo's internal touch handler provide values.
    # In addition, stop clamping the pinch zoom by the page zoom clamp values.  They aren't meant for that.  Instead set up
    # some reasonable clamping values for pinch zoom in the compositor.
    # Also add more rustdoc for public API.
    # Testing: The changes to API naming do not really need tests, and the changes to behavior (the clamping) can't be easily
    # tested now as there is no way currently to read the current pinch zoom level of the WebView.  This requires more API in
    # the renderer.

    # The current code has snippets like `self.convert_string_to_number(&DOMString::from(attr.summarize().value))` in various
    # places.
    # The snippet wants to take the value of an attribute and parse it as a number.  In theory this is an easy problem, the
    # attribute internally stores a `AttrValue` (which can be treated as `str`) and the conversion code wants a `str` - no
    # conversions or copies necessary!
    # But the reality of what happens is less ideal: `attr.summarize` allocates a `AttrInfo` containing owned copies of the
    # attributes namespace, name and value.  The name and value are also converted from the `AttrValue` to a `DOMString` and
    # then back to a `String` in the process.  And then we take the value field from `AttrInfo` and create a new DOMString
    # from it, passing that to `self.self.convert_string_to_number` - which ends up internally calling `str()` on it.
    # All in all this is not a big issue, because this code doesn't run often.  But it's also not hard to fix, and we end up
    # with cleaner code in the process.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39894	(@kkoyung, #39894)	script: Simplify dictionary conversion in `SubtleCrypto` (#39894)
    webcrypto
    # WebCrypto API implementation involves a lot of conversion between JS values and many different WebIDL dictionaries.  We
    # currently have two helper functions, `value_from_js_object` and `boxed_value_from_js_object`, to convert JS values into
    # different WebIDL dictionaries.
    # These two helper functions use `T::new`, where `T` is the WebIDL dictionary type, to convert the values.  Since `T::new`
    # does not belong to any trait, to make the helper functions work with different WebIDL dictionaries as generics, we
    # currently define the `DictionaryFromJSVal` trait to wrap the `new` function.  However, it is inconvenient to implement
    # the trait for each involved WebIDL dictionary.
    # The patch changes the conversion process to use `safe_from_jsval` from the `SafeFromJSValConvertible` trait, instead of
    # the `T::new` function.  Codegen has already implemented the underlying trait `FromJSValConvertible` for those WebIDL
    # dictionaries.  We don't need to manually implement it for each involved WebIDL dictionary.  Hence, we can make our
    # `SubtleCrypto` implementation simpler.
    # Testing: Refactoring.  Existing WPT tests suffice.

    # Follow-up to #39812, using nextests builtin retry feature to rerun flaky unit-tests.  This also adds a per-test timeout,
    # replacing the global timeout set for the retry action.  We could also add a global timeout for nextest tests, but
    # per-test timeouts should be sufficient and noticably speedup CI when individual unit tests get stuck.

    # internally we continue to use a separate code path where the embedder directly communicates with the file manager
    # thread.  subsequent work will make the messages asynchronous via the constellation and script thread, like other

    # Previously, desktop/egui_glue.rs contained a reimplementation of egui_glow::EguiGlow to allow for EguiGlow::paint() to
    # be called multiple times after each Minibrowser::update().  Since the minibrowser no longer does this, we can use the
    # upstream version of EguiGlow again.
    # In the meantime, our EguiGlow::new() had diverged from upstream by initializing accesskit and setting a fallback theme.
    # This is now done in desktop/minibrowser.rs instead.  Switching to upstream also has the effect of setting
    # max_texture_side in egui_winit::State::new() based on what the Painter reports.
    # Testing: Manually tested on linux/wayland that UI still renders and that servo still connects to a11y bus (by running

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/36616	(@pylbrecht, #36616)	Integrate fetch into WebSocket implementation (#36616)
    # # Description
    # For the initial WebSocket handshake, we need to create a proper handshake request and `fetch()` it.  Creating this
    # handshake request begins in `WebSocketMethods::Constructor()`, which sends the partially prepared `RequestBuilder` over
    # to `components/net/resource_thread.rs`.  There we handle the incoming `CoreResourceMsg::Fetch` message and finish
    # creating the handshake request in `components/net/websocket_loader.rs::create_handshake_request()`.  Finally we fetch
    # the request by calling `components/net/fetch/methods.rs::fetch()`.
    # `fetch()` eventually calls `http_network_fetch()`.  This is where the "actual fetching" of the request takes place on a
    # network level, which means we need to handle WebSocket handshake requests differently than non-WebSocket requests.  I
    # mostly moved the existing code, which uses `tungstenite`, with some type massaging (thanks again, @jdm, for helping me
    # out here!).  This included converting from tungstenite types to Servo's net types (request/response).
    # # The tricky bits
    # In order to fetch the handshake request via `components/net/fetch/methods.rs::fetch()`, we need to convert the request
    # URL's scheme from ws(s) to http(s).  Then, we need to "undo" this conversion again when doing CSP checks (i.e.  http(s)
    # back to ws(s)).  To avoid having this "undoing" logic in a bunch of places we introduced `Request::original_url()`,
    # holding the URL before the scheme conversion took place.  Unfortunately this only gets as so far.  There are still some
    # places, where we need to explicitly check and/or convert the URL scheme (e.g.  retroactively upgrading to a secure
    # scheme).

https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39963	(@mrobinson, #39963)	script: Delay screenshots until the first rendering update after `fonts.ready` (#39963)
    # This fixes a regression (likely from #39583) that made the result of many font loading tests intermittent.  The issues
    # here is that the count of fonts loading is decremented synchronously in the `FontContext`, but the notification to the
    # `ScriptThread` happens asynchronously.  In between the time the decrement happens and the `ScriptThread` is notified, a
    # rendering update could happen which could mark a screenshot as ready to take too soon.
    # The solution here is to wait until the `fonts.ready` promise is resolved, which is guaranteed to fire after all fonts
    # have loaded.  In addition, a rendering update is queued after this happens.  This means that the screenshot will wait
    # until that final rendering update to be ready.
    # This should remove the flakiness of font load tests.

    # Explicitly dependending on `accesskit` in servoshell requires the version to be kept in sync with `egui_winit`, which

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39893	(@delan, @mrobinson, #39893)	script: Make file picker selection flow asynchronous (#39893)
    perf
    # Previously the `` would wait synchronously for file selection results from the embedder.  This change moves that
    # synchronous wait to the `FileManager` worker thread.  The main benefit is that script is not blocked waiting for the
    # embedder.  The synchronous wait on the worker thread is not a large issue because it is run from a thread pool, though a
    # later change could also remove that synchronous wait.
    # In addition, the API surface for file selection changes a bit as there is now a `dismiss` method which differentiates
    # between selecting no file and not making a choice at all.
    # Testing: Covered by exiting WPT, WebDriver conformance, and unit tests.

    # 📝 book: Update version of zbus in the sample Cargo.toml.
    #  Launch a multi-threaded tokio runtime for blocking.  Otherwise, any blocking calls in the application code can block
    #  our internal tasks.  This is breaking our &quot;we won't launch threads behind your back&quot; promise a little but its

    # was only enabled on OpenHarmony.  Now all pinch zooms must come with a focal point, which determines the center point of
    # the zoom.  This enables full pinch zoom on Android and has OpenHarmony use the same system for pinch zoom.
    # Every WebView now has a `PinchZoom` which describes the viewport of the pinch zoom and handles panning with proper
    # chaining of zoom viewport panning to scroll layer scrolling.  In addition, the collection of touch actions is simplified
    # by storing an array and turning each into a ScrollZoomEvent when appropriate.
    # Caveats: - We've noticed some hard to diagnose bugs with clamping the panning
    #   viewport, but we'll tackle those later once we figure out how to reliably reproduce them.
    # - Keyboard scroll events currently do not properly pan the pinch zoom
    #    viewport.  This will be handled in a followup.
    # Testing: There are currently no tests for this kind of touch interaction as there's no way to read the pinch zoom from a
    # WebView.  It's processed asynchronously.  Once that API is added, we should be able to add some simple tests, but many
    # things are still unaccessible such as the pan position in the pinch zoom viewport.  Fixes #4224.

    dom
    # The 'media' element has multiple media data processing steps for media source loading and requires properly handling any
    # media network and decoding errors between different components: - element (resource selection algorithm) - fetch
    # context/listener (async response) - media backend (async playback events)
    # The fetch listener will stop processing any actions (response/chunk/eof) in case if current fetch request was cancelled
    # (due to a network/decoding error or it was aborted by user).
    # Also send EOS event to media backend ONLY once the entire media resource has been fetched so media pipeline will not
    # generate decoding (playback) error for fetched empty sources (eg.  "about:blank" or "data:,").

    ohos
    # On recent versions of HarmonyOS the previous JIT detection does not appear to work anymore, since the second `mmap`
    # succeeds.  This moves the failure in spidermonkey to a later point, when SM remaps memory to be writable.  On recent
    # versions of HOS I observed that the `PROT_WRITE` permission was silently ignored by mprotect, which lead to a crash
    # later on the first attempt to write to the memory region.  It's not exactly easy to determine if one can write to a
    # memory location (if mprotect lies to you), but we can use `read` to check if the memory region is writable (without
    # triggering a segfault), since `read` will return an error for invalid addresses (which is possible since the writing is
    # handled in the kernel).
    # Since this solution does add more unsafe code than before, we only use this detection on OpenHarmony, although we could
    # use it on more platforms later if there are other platforms which also may have JIT forbidden.

-https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40136	(@mrobinson, #40136)	pixels: Split `Snapshot` into `SharedSnapshot` and `Snapshot` (#40136)
    # This splits `Snapshot` into two structs:
    # - `Snapshot`: A non-serializable owned image buffer that might contain
    #   either shared memory or a `Vec`.  When mutated the shared memory version is converted into a `Vec` avoiding a copy of
    #   the data until absolutely necessary.
    # - `SharedSnapshot`: A serialzable version of `Snapshot` that contains
    #   only shared memory and is suitable for sending across IPC channels.  This version is cheaply convertible from and to
    #   owned `Snapshot`s as long as the source is also a shared memory `Snapshot`.
    # In addition, it does copyless conversions of `RasterImage` into `Snapshot`s (including for frame offsets in animated
    # images).  Finally, there are a few minor changes to try harder not to have to do a `transform()` operation.
    # Testing: This should not change observable behavior, so is covered by existing tests.  It should come with a mild
    # performance improvement and open up the opportunity for others.  Fixes: #36594.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40240	(@mrobinson, #40240)	android: Let Servo handle touch events (#40240)
    servoshell
    # This change makes it so that Servo handles touch events on Android.  Flinging becomes a bit less native, but with two
    # big benefits:
    # 1.  Before touch event handling on Android wasn't standards compliant,
    #    because web content didn't get a chance to call `preventDefault()` on touch events, whcih important for proper site
    #    behavior.
    # 2.  This unifies all touch event handling across Servo platforms.  This
    #    means that improvements to things like fling will benefit all platforms equally.  In addition, fling on Android can
    #    be integrated into Servo's animation handler.
    # Generally, this also just makes things much simpler to reason about on Android.
    # Testing: This kind of input handling isn't tested in Servo yet.

    # by the `flate2` crate (https://crates.io/crates/flate2).
    # `flate2` supports several different backends, controlled through the crate's features.  By default, it uses
    # `miniz_oxide` (https://crates.io/crates/miniz_oxide).
    # `flate2` provides three modules `read`, `write` and `bufread` which work on instances of the `std::io::Read`,
    # `std::io::Write` and `std::io::Bufread` traits, respectively.  The `write` module is chosen in the patch since it
    # matches the streaming model in the specification.

    # This change splits `IOCompositor` into two structs: `IOCompositor` and `Painter`.  The idea is that `Painter` will be
    # per-`RenderingContext`.  Currently there is only one, but when there is more than one there will be one `Painter`
    # per-`RenderingContext`.  Therefore, everything that we suspect will be managed this way is moved to `Painter`.
    # In addition, to avoid the risk of double-borrows, `WebViewRender` no longer keeps a reference to any of the containing
    # structs.  Instead necessary things are passed down when necessary or stored internally.

    # This patch doesn't change how the script requests the dialogs to be displayed, it only switches the webview delegate

    # https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40289#discussion_r2479889037 intend to process `headless` param properly.
    # For either `servo` or `servodriver` binary, the expected behaviour is: - When given one test, it should depends on cmd
    # arg `--headless` - With multiple tests, we always default to `--headless`
    # The subtle point is: `ServoWdspecBrowser` didn't process `headless` param at all and always default to headless.  Also,
    # `executor_kwargs` does not work for it but only `browser_kwargs` works as it does not use `ServoExecutor`.
    # Testing: Manually tested with legacy driver, running in single/multiple tests, with/without headless param, with wdspec
    # or none-wdspec test.  Fixes: https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40289#discussion_r2479889037

    # Rust 1.90 uses lld by default on linux, which should improve link time and memory usage (I personally override ld with

    webdriver
    # This change adds a 10 second timeout for screenshots.  Without this timeout, tests that fail take a screenshot in a
    # reasonable amount of time cause the the WebDriver driver to kill the process leading to a CRASH test result.  This
    # causes the results to differ and to obscure what is really a TIMEOUT.
    # This behavior is unspecified, but it's still an improvement, as it properly classifies failures when the WPT is run with
    # WebDriver.
    # Testing: This causes some WPT tests run with WebDriver to have their expected result.

    # when its provided.  Additionally, when more than a single test is run, turn on headless mode automatically to preserve
    # existing behavior.
    # Although this change is for the legacy test driver, this will allow the WebDriver test runner to run properly without
    # providing the `--headless` argument.

+https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40278	(@simonwuelker, #40278)	script: Don't unregister slots from their shadow root when the whole shadow tree is being unbound (#40278)
    dom
    # Each shadow root holds a map of slot names to slot elements.  Slot elements dynamically register and unregister
    # themselves at their respective shadow root when they are bound and unbound from the tree.
    # Previously, they were doing this too often.  When a slot element is unbound from the tree then it might still be
    # connected to its shadow root, in case the entire shadow tree is being unbound.
    # Fixing this requires the slot element to know whether it was in a shadow tree prior to `bind_to_tree` being called (then
    # it's already registered and doesn't need to do so again), and whether it will be in a shadow tree after
    # `unbind_from_tree` is called (then there's no need to unregister).
