## Collaborators

After demonstrated competence at both writing and reviewing code for a component of Servo, we will consider granting merge and (formal) review privileges to new members. If you're interested, please ask a member of the TSC, and they will verify with an appropriate super-reviewer before granting these privileges.

This verification will involve the super-reviewer ensuring the proposed reviewer's feedback is consistent with the expectations of the project.

While review privileges are traditionally project-wide, it is also possible to have specific review privileges for certain repositories. This is controlled using `extra_reviewers` in the Homu config, as opposed to the main reviewers list.

The current reviewers' GitHub usernames are available at: <https://github.com/servo/saltfs/blob/master/homu/files/cfg.toml>. This drives our installation of <https://github.com/barosl/homu>, our autolander, which is the only approved way to commit changes to the Servo repositories.
